<p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>
紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。</p>

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.</p>

在馬德里外圍的瓜達利斯山裡，阿根廷馴馬師費爾南多．諾瓦耶斯出動他的動物，來幫助蒙受壓力與焦慮的民眾。這位曾在巴塔哥尼亞原野與馬兒生活多年的57歲男子，用這些動物做為病人解讀與控制自身情緒的一種方法。每堂課收費高達120歐元的諾瓦耶斯說，來到他課堂的民眾和馬兒共度時光，並透過馬兒的動作，來認識自身當下的心理狀態。他說，「馬是面鏡子。」「牠們是群居動物，天生活在馬群裡。」這種療法在於監測馬兒如何呼應客戶心情。他說，從觀察馬的反應，客戶學會如何辨識和控制情緒。他說：「處於困難心理狀態之中時，民眾上第一堂課，看著一匹動不停、甚至狂奔的馬兒。這匹馬對你顯示了一顆受到折磨的不停歇的心。」（路透）</p>

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops. The horse is showing you a mind that doesn’t stop, that is tormented," he says.（Reuters）</p>

查克．麥卡錫的散步服務以每小時30美元的價格，提供新鮮空氣、運動與同伴情誼—不過在樹旁撒尿可絕對不行。這位洛杉磯企業家作為該市第一個遛人公司的創辦人，是與人類配合工作，而非動物，並捍衛健康與社會包容。「我考慮成為一名遛狗師。但我未曾在這座城市養過狗。」麥卡錫說。「我也看到許多私人教練的廣告。因此我對女友說『或許我就成為遛人師』。」麥卡錫在說笑，但當他越加思考，就越了解有對他能提供的那種同伴之誼的需求。「遛人師」2年前以1人運作方式開始營運。但需求之高，致使麥卡錫現在值勤表上有35名陪走者，人們可在網站上選擇路線與步行夥伴。不是因為人們的朋友變少，專家說，而是「零工經濟」已產生一個自由工作者世代，相關工作沒有傳統上聯繫工作者的例行公事或社會連結。</p>

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.</p>

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. The needs of friendship. The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. <strong>However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch.</strong> People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.</p>

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.</p>

地球的大氣中，無時無刻都含有約13兆公升的水蒸氣，相當於地表上所有淡水資源的10%。一款新開發的吸附劑近來顯示，即便相對濕度降至約10%，它也能從大氣中收穫水汽。在這種條件下，每100萬公升的空氣可產出約3公升的水。這款概念驗證裝置由美國麻省理工學院、加州大學柏克萊分校的協同團隊研發，使用柏克萊化學系教授奧馬．亞吉在1990年代發明的一種「金屬有機骨架（MOF）」材料。化學家利用金屬和有機分子，控制能與「金屬有機骨架」結合的氣體種類及其鍵結強度。該裝置本身可簡單分為兩個主要部分：吸收層（又稱MOF）和作為空氣冷凝器的封套。MOF的背面會塗成黑色，用來吸收太陽能。</p>

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.</p>

So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.</p>

In most Western countries, it seems common for workers to spend lunch breaks in the gym, but in Sweden, some employers have extended their thinking to make the sport an obligation to work. Every Friday, employees of the Swedish sportswear retailer "Bjorn Berger" leave the office of the Stockholm company headquarters and go to a nearby gym for weekly exercise. No one can make exceptions because this is hosted by the Swedish tennis legend Bjorn. Berger founded the company and has been performing as a wrestler as the 44-year-old CEO Hankler in more than two years. Bunge's initiative forced employees to exercise during work hours. "If you don't want to exercise or you don't want to integrate into corporate culture, you have to leave." Bunge said with no embarrassment. He also mentioned that so far no one has resigned because of this request. <strong>The main goal of this policy is to increase the friendship between colleagues in addition to increasing productivity and profits.</strong></p>

日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。</p>

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.</p>

A Japanese railway company left the station 25 seconds earlier to cause the train to apologize for "any inconvenience". <strong>This is the second such incident in recent months.</strong> The train originally set off at Notogawa Station in Shiga Prefecture, Japan at 7:12 a.m. The conductor thought that the train should be separated at 7:11 a.m., so he closed the door early. At that time, although he found a mistake, he decided to leave because he saw no one on the platform. Early driving did not affect the travel itinerary of any passengers, but there are still passengers wishing to catch a car. They complained to the railway operator "West Japan Railway Co., Ltd." that soon an official apology statement was issued. The Japanese train enjoys a reputation for being extremely punctual. A similar incident took place last fall, when a Tokyo-bound train to the eastern city of Tsukuba set off 20 seconds earlier, causing the operator, Tsukuba Express, to issue a public statement apologizing.</p>

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again.</p>

According to a study published on Tuesday (May 1st), wood frogs will keep urinating throughout the winter and survive through the recovery of urea. <strong>(U.S.) Alaskan wood frogs can not urinate for 8 months.</strong> Now scientists have figured out what they did; more precisely, how they survived without urinating. The research report published in the "Royal Society Report Biosciences" magazine pointed out that the frog's intestine has special microorganisms that can recover urea, which is the main waste in urine.

袋鼠是澳洲觀光引人入勝的要角之一，但一家公園的遊客所獲超乎了他們所求。距離雪梨有兩小時火車路程的麥覺理湖市觀光客忽略警示，餵袋鼠吃紅蘿蔔，牠們一看到最愛之含糖零食就變得具有攻擊性。受到保證「可愛野生袋鼠」是「溫馴到可以靠近及一起拍照」的眾多旅遊部落格誘惑，每週有數千人蜂擁來看一家精神病院附近草坡上的袋鼠。手裡拿紅蘿蔔，遊客接近袋鼠，想和澳洲象徵來個自拍。但結局並非一向美好。一張貼到臉書的照片顯示，一隻袋鼠跳起來，用牠有力的腿踢了一名遊客。其他照片顯示，一名婦女臉遭抓傷，一名男子流血破肚。經營到這處公園觀光巴士服務的謝恩．路易斯告訴路透，「不論在什麼情境下，袋鼠可能偶爾具有侵略性，但九成是試著餵牠們的民眾被攻擊。」</p>

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.</p>

The kangaroo is one of the most important cornerstones of Australian tourism, but visitors to a park have exceeded what they asked for. Tourists in Lake Macquarie who are two hours by train from Sydney ignore warnings and feed kangaroos to eat carrots. Once they see their favorite sugary snacks, they become aggressive. The guaranteed "Cute Wild Kangaroo" is a temptation to "tremendously can be approached and photographed" by many travel bloggers. Thousands of people flock to the kangaroos on a grassy slope near a mental hospital every week. With carrots in hand, visitors approached Kangaroo and wanted to take a selfie with the Australian symbol. But the outcome is not always beautiful. A photo posted on Facebook shows a kangaroo jumping up and kicking a visitor with his strong legs. Other photos showed a woman's face was scratched and a man was bleeding. <strong>Sheen, who runs this park sightseeing bus service.</strong> Louis told Reuters, "While in any situation, kangaroos may occasionally be aggressive, but 90% of the people who try to feed them are attacked."</p>

In contrast, the mice given high potassium had less artery hardening.The vital mineral － which spuds, broccoli and sprouts are also rich in － was found to aid blood flow to the heart and brain and reduce the risk of clots. Other foods rich in the mineral include parsnips, seeds, fish and poultry.However, eating too much potassium can cause stomach ache, nausea and diarrhea. Older people may be more at risk because their kidneys may be less able to remove potassium from the blood.</p>

New research has revealed that eating bananas every day may help prevent heart attacks and strokes. <strong>Potassium-rich foods such as bananas can prevent fatal cardiovascular blockages and inhibit arteriosclerosis and stenosis.</strong> University of Alabama researchers analyzed mice at risk of heart disease. These mice were fed low, medium, or high levels of potassium, and the results showed that the mouse arteries given a low potassium diet hardened. In contrast, mice fed high potassium had less atherosclerosis.

（英國）哈利王子和梅根．馬克爾5月19日即將完婚。這對小倆口將在溫莎古堡的聖喬治禮拜堂結婚，那是一處皇家宅邸，位於距離倫敦市中心西方約22英里的一座小鎮內。聖喬治禮拜堂的鐘聲即將為這樁幸福大事敲響，但收銀台的鈴聲早已響起。觀光業是溫莎鎮迄今規模最大的產業。感謝王室家族，每年都有700萬名遊客結伴到訪這座小鎮，婚禮當天則預計再增加10萬訪客，帶動當地經濟。當地議會的副主席菲利普．比克內爾預期，會有許多出手闊綽的美國觀光客到訪。「美國人非常熱衷這場婚禮，因為終於有美國人即將成為王室一員。」比克內爾表示。坐落於溫莎古堡山腳下的「國王與王后禮物店」裡，哈利與梅根的紀念商品持續暢銷。觀光客搶購印上這對幸福小倆口的冰箱磁鐵、T恤、茶巾和杯具，為此掏出18美元或更多的錢。這場王室婚禮引領鋪天蓋地的皇家圖飾風潮，包括一些稀奇古怪的產品，例如哈利與梅根早餐穀片，顯然旨在輕鬆賺取近利。</p>

Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.</p>
