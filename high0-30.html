<p><strong>"A collection manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science, when updating the electronic system catalog, discovered this "real" pale yellow egg in more than 1,000 egg collections."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>
紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。</p>

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.</p>

在馬德里外圍的瓜達利斯山裡，阿根廷馴馬師費爾南多．諾瓦耶斯出動他的動物，來幫助蒙受壓力與焦慮的民眾。這位曾在巴塔哥尼亞原野與馬兒生活多年的57歲男子，用這些動物做為病人解讀與控制自身情緒的一種方法。每堂課收費高達120歐元的諾瓦耶斯說，來到他課堂的民眾和馬兒共度時光，並透過馬兒的動作，來認識自身當下的心理狀態。他說，「馬是面鏡子。」「牠們是群居動物，天生活在馬群裡。」這種療法在於監測馬兒如何呼應客戶心情。他說，從觀察馬的反應，客戶學會如何辨識和控制情緒。他說：「處於困難心理狀態之中時，民眾上第一堂課，看著一匹動不停、甚至狂奔的馬兒。這匹馬對你顯示了一顆受到折磨的不停歇的心。」（路透）</p>

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops. The horse is showing you a mind that doesn’t stop, that is tormented," he says.（Reuters）</p>

瑪索梅．阿堤被公公朝臉上潑酸而失明，但她不想只因為曾遭到邪惡對待，而被人們記住。她想成為一名藝術家。8年前，這名35歲的伊朗婦女永久性毀容，只因為她提出離婚。由於伊朗厲行伊斯蘭教律法，她從未獲得平反。最後，夫家還威脅，若她提出告訴，她的兒子將遭到相同懲罰。她說：「我選擇了兒子，而非正義。」但她也說，她已放下這個令人痛心疾首的決定，拒絕因為這個決定而精神崩潰。最近，她參加一個由其他潑酸受害者組成的團體，一起在德黑蘭一家藝廊展出作品，以提升社會關注及募款。阿堤創作陶器，雕刻碗盆和雕塑品。逃家後，她現在與12歲的兒子住在德黑蘭，為其他失明者上藝術課。她自豪地說，自己已「完全獨立」。</p>

Eight years ago, the 35-year-old Iranian woman was permanently disfigured simply because she had filed a divorce. Since Iran’s strict implementation of Islamic law, she has never been rehabilitated. In the end, the husband’s family also threatened that if she offered to tell, her son would suffer the same punishment. She said: "I chose my son, not justice." But she also said that she had let go of this heartbreaking decision and refused to collapse because of this decision. <strong>Recently, she participated in a group of victims of other acid abuse, exhibiting works together at a gallery in Tehran to raise social concerns and fundraising.</strong> Adi created pottery, carved bowls and sculptures.

And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.</p>

西班牙文「國家報」報導，一名受到神職人員性侵犯的智利男子表示，教宗方濟各告訴他，天主造他為同志，也愛如此的他。性侵受害者胡安‧卡洛斯‧克魯茲告訴「國家報」，教宗在私下對話時告訴他：「你是同性戀並不重要。天主如此造你，也愛如此的你，我不會在乎。教宗愛如此的你，你必須對自己感到快樂。」</p>

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.</p>

法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）</p>

和他以迴避搭機聞名的獨裁者父親不同，北韓領導人金正恩搭機前往中國東北部城市大連，成為32年來首位搭機出訪的北韓統治者。自2011年底執政以來，金正恩偶爾會在北韓國內搭乘飛機。最近這趟（訪中）海外行程，儘管（地點）距離北韓邊界不遠，時間點落在他與美國總統唐納．川普會面、以解決北韓核武問題為主旨的高峰會之前。金正恩曾在瑞士求學多年，據信在青少年時期經常搭機。成為北韓領導人後，（北韓）國營媒體說，金正恩曾搭乘「蒼鷹1號」校閱參與空中戰鬥競賽的空軍機隊，與視察平壤的建設工程。北韓媒體發佈的照片也顯示，金正恩坐在專機內朝窗外看、步下專機階梯，以及與妻子李雪主聯袂踏上機場跑道的紅地毯。（美聯社）</p>

Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）</p>

Different from his dictator father, who is known for avoiding flights, North Korean leader Kim Jung-un took a plane to Dalian, the northeastern city of China, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly in 32 years. <strong>Since taking office in late 2011, Kim Jong-un occasionally flies in North Korea</strong>Recently this trip (visiting China) overseas trip, although (location) not far from the North Korean border, the time point fell on him and US President Donner.**ner. Trump met before the summit aimed at resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. Kim Jong-un had studied in Switzerland for many years and he is believed to have frequent flights during his youth. After becoming a North Korean leader, the (North Korea) state-run media said that Kim Jong-un had used "Goshawk 1" to read the air force fleet participating in the air combat competition and to inspect the construction project in Pyongyang. Photographs released by North Korean media also show Kim Jong-un sitting in the plane, looking out of the window, stepping down the plane, and joining his wife Li Xue’s red carpet on the airport runway.
