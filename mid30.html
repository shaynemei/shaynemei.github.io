<p><strong>"The needs of friendship."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>
查克．麥卡錫的散步服務以每小時30美元的價格，提供新鮮空氣、運動與同伴情誼—不過在樹旁撒尿可絕對不行。這位洛杉磯企業家作為該市第一個遛人公司的創辦人，是與人類配合工作，而非動物，並捍衛健康與社會包容。「我考慮成為一名遛狗師。但我未曾在這座城市養過狗。」麥卡錫說。「我也看到許多私人教練的廣告。因此我對女友說『或許我就成為遛人師』。」麥卡錫在說笑，但當他越加思考，就越了解有對他能提供的那種同伴之誼的需求。「遛人師」2年前以1人運作方式開始營運。但需求之高，致使麥卡錫現在值勤表上有35名陪走者，人們可在網站上選擇路線與步行夥伴。不是因為人們的朋友變少，專家說，而是「零工經濟」已產生一個自由工作者世代，相關工作沒有傳統上聯繫工作者的例行公事或社會連結。</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong><br/>
Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.</p>

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. <strong>The needs of friendship.</strong> The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch. People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.</p>

法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）</p>

French President Emmanuel. Mark Macro went to Washington last week to conduct a state visit with Donner. President Trump planted a tree on the White House land to celebrate the special relationship between the United States and France. The oak seedling is now missing - at least for the time being. White House photographers noticed that the tree disappeared a few days after it was planted. <strong>The mystery goes up.</strong> In fact, the tree from France's Belo Forest - a battle in the First World War that killed nearly 2,000 soldiers in the United States - was dug shortly after being planted. According to US and French officials, it was quarantined. The problem lies in the fact that parasites in trees may spread to other trees on the White House estate. An official in Mark Hong’s office said: “Actually, the kind of tree that can be planted on the day of the president’s visit is a special courtesy to Trump by Trump.” (Reuters)</p>

When Lebanese chef Alan Geaam first arrived in Paris two decades ago he found himself sleeping on the streets, lost and penniless with hardly a word of French.Geaam, who began his career as a dishwasher, finally received his first Michelin star from the French gastronomic bible for his acclaimed new restaurant.In the childhood Geaam had a fascination with food, watching cookery shows on television rather than cartoons after school. He started cooking while doing his national service in Lebanon, and the colonel of his regiment was so impressed he made him his personal chef.But Geaam never thought he would be able to cut the mustard in France. "I worked during the day as a construction worker and at night delivering pizzas and washing dishes. One night the cook cut his hand and had to go to hospital. No one asked me, but I just took over. There were 14 tables and I just feed the customers and at the end of the night they were delighted."</p>

Jim, who started his career as a dish washer, finally won the star rating of the Michelin, the Bible of the French catering industry, for his first time in the highly acclaimed new restaurant. Jim is fascinated with food from pissing, watching TV after school is not about cartoons, but cooking shows. He started cooking when he was serving in Lebanon, so that the colonel's colonel was impressed and invited him to serve as a private chef. However, after Jim came to France, he never thought he was qualified enough to cook. “I was a construction worker during the day and I went to pizza and dishes in the evening. One night, the chef cut a hand into the hospital. Although no one asked me, I took over his job. At that time there were 14 guests and I cooked them. Finally, they enjoyed eating very much."</p>

取道那條行經荷蘭耶爾瑟姆村的公路，它將為你奏上一曲。由策略性鋪設的「減速標線」所製造出的歌曲，是讓橫越那段平坦風景的路程充滿生氣的方式，但這條新奇道路已讓當地人們興味索然，他們說持續嗡嗡作響的旋律要把他們逼瘋了。曲調會在汽車輪胎壓過標線時揚出，這些標線通常配置於主要道路旁，以警告駕駛他們正偏離道路。若以正確速度壓過標線——時速60公里上限——這條路會唱出荷蘭北部擁有不同語言和文化的菲士蘭地區省歌。但音量很大且聲音四傳，當地人說，這條聲音美妙的道路造成了讓他們夜間醒來的無盡雜音。菲士蘭當局已同意本週稍後拆掉這段減速標線。（路透）</p>

Take the highway past the Dutch village of Jelsum and the road will play you a tune.Created by strategically laid "rumble strips" as a way of livening up journeys across the flat landscape, the novelty has worn thin for locals who say the constant droning melody is driving them mad.The tune is created when car tyres drive over the strips - which are usually deployed at the side of major roads to warn drivers they are straying off course.If hit at the correct speed - the 60 kph limit - the road will sing out the anthem of the Friesland region - a northern part of the Netherlands that has a distinct language and culture.But it is loud and the sound travels, and locals say the musical road had created a never-ending cacophony that keeps them awake at night.The Friesland authority has agreed to remove the rumble strips later this week. （Reuters）</p>

Take the road that passes through the village of Jelsdam in the Netherlands and it will play for you. The songs created by the strategically placed “deceleration markings” are a lively way to get across the stretch of flat scenery. However, this novel road has caused local people to feel uncomfortable. They said that they continued to buzz. <strong>The melody will drive them crazy.</strong> The tune will be raised as the car's tires pass over the markings, which are usually placed alongside the main road to warn them that they are deviating from the road. If you pass the mark at the correct speed – 60 km/h – this road will sing the provincial song of the Farsland region with different languages ​​and cultures in the north of the Netherlands. However, the volume was loud and the voices spread four times. Locals said that this wonderful road sounded endless noise that caused them to wake up at night. The authorities in the Philippines have agreed to remove this deceleration mark later this week. (Reuters)</p>

Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino have responded to director Peter Jackson’s comments that Harvey Weinstein blacklisted them. Jackson said in an interview with New Zealand media outlet Stuff that Harvey and Bob Weinstein specifically told him not to hire Judd or Sorvino for the "Lord of the Rings" movies."I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998," Jackson said of Judd and Sorvino. "I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing."On Friday, Sorvino tweeted that she "burst out crying" when she read the interview."There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure," she wrote. "Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I’m just heartsick."</p>

諺語有云「善有善報」—格林威牧師的例子就是明證。2016年他與家人在一家書店和一名遊民偶遇後，給予該男庇護。貝爾發斯特男子梅爾文．伯伊德之前陷入困境，但他說，他遇見格林威牧師一家，並開始與他們一起生活後，他的生命改變。而當伯伊德將他的一枚腎提供給需要器官移植的牧師後，他反過來也改變了一個生命。伯伊德說，街頭生活艱困，他無法信任任何人。在與牧師的兒子會面後，他將他帶進這個家，格林威家幫助伯伊德克服酗酒，重新開始。格林威牧師說：「我相信梅爾文的生命需要一個新的開始，我們想幫他。」此後，伯伊德與這個家度過每個日夜，也成為牧師伉儷的另一個兒子，他們已有4名子女。去年3月，他捐贈一枚腎臟，回報牧師的寬大慷慨。格林威牧師罹患腎衰竭，在手術前已洗腎近1年。這時伯伊德介入。他說：「這中間沒有掙扎。我相信註定要如此。」</p>

Here is a saying ’one good turn deserves another’ - and in Pastor John Greenaway’s case, it has proved to be true.He and his family gave shelter to a homeless man in 2016, after a chance meeting in a book shop. Belfast man Melvin Boyd had fallen on hard times, but said once he met Pastor Greenaway’s family and began living with them, his life changed. In turn, Boyd changed a life when he offered the pastor, who needed an organ transplant, one of his kidneys.Boyd said living on the streets was difficult and that he could not trust anyone. After meeting the pastor’s son, who brought him to the family home, the Greenaway family helped Boyd to beat his alcohol addiction and start over.Pastor Greenaway said： "I believed Melvin needed a new start in life, we wanted to help him" Since then, Boyd has stayed at the family home every day and night, and has become another son to the pastor, and his wife, who already have four children.Last March, he repaid the pastor for his generosity by donating one of his kidneys to him. Pastor Greenaway had kidney failure and had been on dialysis for almost a year before the operation. That’s when Mr Boyd stepped in. He said： "There was no agonising about it. I believe it was meant to be."</p>

JPSS-1正式以NOAA-20的身分與大家見面。不過，以JPSS-1為首的一系列衛星仍然稱為JPSS系列。依循往例，美國國家海洋暨大氣總署（NOAA）在策劃、設計與建造繞極衛星時，會分派字母（A、B、C…）區別每顆衛星。而當衛星發射升空抵達運行軌道時，會再分派數字編號。「聯合極軌衛星系統」的繞極衛星（JPSS-1、JPSS-2、JPSS-3、JPSS-4）有些許不同。它們在建造、測試與發射階段就被分派數字，而未使用字母。儘管如此，它們抵達運行軌道時，還是會成為NOAA-20、NOAA-21、NOAA-22、NOAA-23。為什麼要從「JPSS」改名為「NOAA」？根據NOAA文獻，改名可延續命名規則的一致性；除NOAA與美國國家航太總署（NASA）的「索米國家極軌夥伴關係」（Suomi NPP）衛星外，該機構自1978年以來，便遵循這項繞極衛星的命名規則。</p>

JPSS-1 officially became known as NOAA-20. However, the entire series of satellites, of which JPSS-1 is the first, is still referred to as the JPSS series.Traditionally, when NOAA’s polar-orbiting satellites were planned, designed and built, NOAA assigned each one with a letter (-A, -B, -C …). Then, when the satellite reached orbit after launch, it was given a number. The polar-orbiting satellites of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1, -2, -3, and -4) are a bit different. Instead of letters, they are designated by numbers during their construction, testing, and launch phases. However, they still become NOAA-20, -21, -22, and -23 when they attain orbit. Why will their names change from "JPSS" to "NOAA"? According to NOAA documentation, the change is to maintain consistency in naming conventions that NOAA has followed since 1978 for polar-orbiting satellites, except for the NOAA-NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (Suomi NPP).</p>

JPSS-1 officially met with everyone as NOAA-20. However, a series of satellites headed by JPSS-1 are still called the JPSS series. Following the example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States will assign letters (A, B, C...) to distinguish each satellite when planning, designing, and constructing the orbiting satellite.

For the first time, strange alien ice has been seen forming on Earth by US researchers. This revelation was made by the researchers at Stanford University on July 8, 2017. The researchers dubbed the alien ice as ice seven, which forms naturally in the environment when planetary ice bodies collide."These experiments with water are the first of their kind, allowing us to witness a fundamental disorder-to-order transition in one of the most abundant molecules in the universe," said study lead author Arianna Gleason, a visiting scientist in the Extreme Environments Laboratory of Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences.Most powerful X-ray lasers were used by the researchers to create ice VII with the help of Linac Coherent Light Source. Another instrument called X-ray Free Electron Laser is used to beam the compressed water. This transformation took place in just six billionths of a second, or nanoseconds during the procedure.</p>

For the first time in history, American researchers witnessed the formation of a strange "exoplanet ice" on the earth. On July 8, 2017, researchers at Stanford University realized the initiative. When the frozen planets collided, the ice VII, which the researchers nicknamed "exoplanet ice," would naturally occur in the space environment. "This type of water experiment is the first in history to allow us to witness one of the most abundant molecules in the universe, an important shift from chaos to order," said the study's lead author, Stanford University’s Academy of Earth and Energy and Environment, and extreme environments. <strong>Arianna, a laboratory visiting scholar.</strong> Grison said. The researcher uses the "straight accelerator co-modulation light source" to use the strongest "X-ray laser" to produce "Ice 7". Another instrument called "X-ray free electron laser" is used to send compressed water molecules. The process of turning water molecules into ice only takes about one-sixth of a six-millionth of a second, which is equivalent to 6 nanoseconds.</p>

天主教教宗方濟各要求改變主禱文中一句有關試探的譯文。既有的措辭「不要領我們進入試探」不是好譯文，因為上帝不會領人犯罪，他說。他的建議是改用「不要讓我們陷入試探」，他告訴義大利電視台。主禱文是基督教最知名的祈禱文。教宗說，法國的羅馬天主教會現在使用新語詞「不要讓我們陷入試探」作為替代，類似用語應該通行全球。「不要讓我陷入試探因為是我落入，而不是上帝將我丟入試探，然後看著我如何墮落，」他說。「做父親的不會這樣，他會立刻幫助你站起來。」該譯文出自第四世紀聖經拉丁譯本「拉丁通行本」，該譯本則是翻譯自古希臘語、希伯來語以及亞蘭語。自開始擔任教宗以來，方濟各不迴避爭議，並且正面處理一些議題。他之前表示，羅馬天主教會應該對其對待同性戀者的方式向他們致歉。</p>

Pope Francis has called for a translation of a phrase about temptation in the Lord’s Prayer to be changed. The current wording that says "lead us not into temptation" is not a good translation because God does not lead humans to sin, he said. His suggestion is to use "do not let us fall into temptation" instead, he told Italian TV.The Lord’s Prayer is the best-known prayer in Christianity. The pontiff said France’s Roman Catholic Church was now using the new wording "do not let us fall into temptation" as an alternative, and something similar should be used worldwide."Do not let me fall into temptation because it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation and then sees how I fell," he said. "A father does not do that, a father helps you to get up immediately."It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, a 4th-Century Latin translation of the Bible, which itself was translated from ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.Since the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has not shied away from controversy and has tackled some issues head-on. He has previously said the Roman Catholic Church should apologise to gay people for the way it has treated them.</p>

Seoul prosecutors said Thursday they have launched an investigation into allegations that the National Intelligence Service under the former conservative Lee Myung-bak administration compiled a blacklist of artists and cultural figures unfriendly to the government and gave or attempted to give them various disadvantages.The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said it has been asked by an NIS internal reform task force to look into suspicions that two top ex-NIS officials are involved in the scheme, in violation of the agency’s laws stipulating political neutrality and prohibiting abuse of power.The NIS task force has found that its former chief Won Sei-hoon and another ranking official created a watch list of some 82 actors, film directors, columnists and singers to persecute them for their critical stance toward the Lee administration.The two former NIS officials allegedly had their subordinates exert pressure on government agencies to conduct tax probes on entertainment agencies that had contracts with those artists. They also peddled influence on public broadcasters to exclude them from the mainstream media.</p>

Seoul prosecutors said on Thursday that they had filed a blacklist of non-pro-government arts writers against the conservative National Intelligence Service during the former government of Lee Myung-bak, and gave or attempted to give unequal treatment and investigate. The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office pointed out that it had received an internal reform project team from the National Institute of Circumstances requesting the investigation of the top two former Supreme Court officials involved in the case. They allegedly violated the law that the hospital must maintain political neutrality and prohibit abuse of power. The country team’s ad hoc group found that its former dean Yuan Shixun and another high-ranking official listed a list of about 82 actors, film directors, columnists, and singers, who were critical of Lee’s government. <strong>And suppress them.</strong> The two former officials of the State Department of the People's Republic of China have alleged that the Afghan ministry pressures government agencies to conduct tax inspections on entertainment institutions contracted by those artists.

天文學家們已辨識出迄今在宇宙中發現的最小恆星，說它可幫助搜尋可能具有讓生命存在的潛力、類似地球的行星。這顆恆星位於600光年外，只比土星大一點。土星的半徑約是地球的9.5倍，而恆星通常遠大於行星。這顆命名為「EBLM J0555-57Ab」的新辨識恆星，引力比地球強約300倍。它的半徑是太陽的8.4%，質量則為太陽的8.1%。這顆新辨識的恆星，似乎是恆星可能形成的最小尺寸。恆星需要一定程度的質量，核內才有空間發生氫聚變。若這顆恆星再小一點，似乎就不具有足以維持核融合的質量。研究報告的主要作者、劍橋大學學者亞歷山大．勃第雀爾說，它會因而變成一顆棕矮星，（此類）天體比巨行星大，但比最小的恆星還要小，會放射紅外輻射。</p>

Astronomers have identified the smallest star ever discovered in the Universe and said that it could help in the search for Earth-like planets that may have the potential for life.The star is located 600 light years away and is just larger than Saturn. The radius of Saturn is around 9.5 times that of Earth, but stars are generally much larger than planets.Named EBLM J0555-57Ab, the newly-identified star has a gravitational pull around 300 times stronger than that on Earth. Its radius is 8.4 percent and mass 8.1 percent the size of that of the Sun.It is likely that the newly-identified star is as small as a star can possibly become. Stars require a certain level of mass to enable hydrogen fusion to take place at their cores. Were the star in question to be any smaller, it would not likely have the requisite mass to sustain the nuclear fusion. It would have instead become a brown dwarf, celestial objects that are bigger than giant planets but smaller than the smallest stars and emit infrared radiation, said Alexander Boetticher of the University of Cambridge, the lead author of the study.</p>

A small Canadian town hopes to become a tourist attraction thanks to the internet fame of a homeowner’s giant rhododendron. The 7.6m by 9.1m bush in Ladysmith, British Columbia, is now in peak bloom. The 115-year-old botanical wonder - known as Lady Cynthia - will carry about 4,000 spring blossoms over the next couple of weeks. The rhododendron is often confused for a tree but is actually a shrub.The local historian Rob Johnson, 73, has convinced the town’s Chamber of Commerce to promote "the marvel of nature" as an attraction. "It’s the size of a small house and is a vibrant pink colour," said Johnson. When it is not in bloom, he says it is "just a nice, big, green shrub". He said he realised "we should capitalise on this" when he saw the rhododendron attracting comment online.Local residents in the town of 8,100 have grown accustomed to the huge shrub, which has been in Ladysmith since around 1904. The first owners of the property are said to have brought Lady Cynthia to the forestry community on a sailing ship from Scotland. Ladysmith’s rhododendron is so named because it is a Cynthia hybrid of the plant.</p>

In a tradition dating to Biblical times, men rise at dawn in the rugged Cal Madow mountains of Somaliland in the Horn of Africa to scale rocky outcrops in search of the prized sap of wild frankincense trees.When dried and burned, the sap produces a fragrant smoke which perfumes churches and mosques around the world. Frankincense, along with gold and myrrh, was brought by the Three Kings as gifts in the Gospel account of the birth of Jesus.But now these last intact wild frankincense forests on Earth are under threat as prices have shot up in recent years with the global appetite for essential oils. Overharvesting has led to the trees dying off faster than they can replenish, putting the ancient resin trade at risk.Harvesting frankincense is risky. The trees can grow high on cliff edges, shallow roots gripping bare rock slithering with venomous snakes. Harvesters often slip and tumble down canyon walls.Once the resin is collected, women sort the chunks by color and size. The various classes of resin are shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually Europe and America. Besides its use as incense, frankincense gum is distilled into oil for use in perfumes, skin lotions, medicine and chewing gum.</p>

In the tradition dating back to the biblical age, the “horn of Africa” in the rugged Madonna mountains of Somalialand, the men got up at dawn and climbed the rock to find the precious outcrop of the wild mastic trees. After drying and igniting, the fragrant odor produced by the frankincense tree sap, the churches and mosques all over the world are scented. The frankincense, with gold and myrrh, is the gift of the three kings to the gospel of the birth of Jesus. However, the last complete wild frankincense grove in the earth is currently endangered by the soaring price of global essential oils in recent years. Over-harvesting causes the death rate of Frankincense trees to grow even faster than regeneration, and the ancient resin trade is in danger. <strong>Collecting frankincense is extremely risky.</strong> The frankincense tree grows very high on the edge of the cliff, and the shallow roots cling to the bare rock that the viper snake crawls on. Collectors often slipped and fell down the canyon wall. After the resin was collected, the women were sorted by the color and size of the resin block. All types of resins were shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually to Europe and the Americas. In addition to making incense, mastic gum can be used to make oils, skin care lotions, medicines and chewing gums for perfumes.</p>

According to a report, one in three is so addicted to their phones that they check them constantly during the night. And if you’re in the 18-24 categories, this number goes up to one in two.It may seem harmless - but it’s incredibly damaging. Sleep experts have warned us over and over how looking at our phones at night can compromise our health. It’s all to do with the blue light our phone’s screen gives off.This light tells our body it’s daytime, which means when we do eventually fall back to sleep, that quality of sleep is not as good as it should be. The research said："What smartphones enable people to do is to keep tags of what’s happening, what people are saying, what people are posting. You can do that throughout the day and what smartphones are encouraging people to do is to do that at night."So unless it’s a matter of life or death, make sure you get some good shut eye.

「英國脫歐」已被柯林斯字典命名為年度單字。這個字彙的首次使用紀錄出現在2013年，但在今年的使用量增加了3400%。柯林斯語言內容總管海倫．紐斯泰德表示：「英國脫歐按理說是過去40年來，政治界對英語字典的最重要貢獻，因為水門案醜聞給予評論家和喜劇演員『門』的字根，以令任何事件或醜聞更引人注目。」 「英國脫歐」也被改寫以形容事件的結束，例如「Mexit」意指足球員利昂內爾．梅西的退休，以及「Bradxit」意指安潔莉娜裘莉和布萊德彼特的婚姻告終。 柯林斯年度字彙的其他競爭者還包括「川普主義」。「川普並非第一個政治人物的名字被語言選用：前例有柴契爾主義和雷根經濟學。」紐斯泰德指出：「不過，川普主義身為單字的壽命長度，可能得仰賴他在即將到來的選舉中獲勝。」</p>

’Brexit’ has been named the word of the year by Collins Dictionary. The first recorded usage of the word arrived in 2013 , but this year saw a 3,400% rise."Brexit is arguably politics’ most important contribution to the English language in over 40 years since the Watergate scandal gave commentators and comedians the suffix ’-gate’ to make any incident or scandal more compelling." Helen Newstead, head of language content at Collins said. ’Brexit’ has also been adapted to describe events coming to an end, such as ’Mexit’ for footballer Lionel Messi’s retirement and “Bradxit” for the end of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s marriage Other contenders for Collins’s word of the year included Trumpism. “Trump is not the first politician to have had his name co-opted by language：‘Thatcherism’ and ‘Reaganomics’, for example,” said Newstead. “However, the longevity of Trumpism as a word may depend on his success in the forthcoming election.”</p>
