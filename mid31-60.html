（英國）哈利王子和梅根．馬克爾5月19日即將完婚。這對小倆口將在溫莎古堡的聖喬治禮拜堂結婚，那是一處皇家宅邸，位於距離倫敦市中心西方約22英里的一座小鎮內。聖喬治禮拜堂的鐘聲即將為這樁幸福大事敲響，但收銀台的鈴聲早已響起。觀光業是溫莎鎮迄今規模最大的產業。感謝王室家族，每年都有700萬名遊客結伴到訪這座小鎮，婚禮當天則預計再增加10萬訪客，帶動當地經濟。當地議會的副主席菲利普．比克內爾預期，會有許多出手闊綽的美國觀光客到訪。「美國人非常熱衷這場婚禮，因為終於有美國人即將成為王室一員。」比克內爾表示。坐落於溫莎古堡山腳下的「國王與王后禮物店」裡，哈利與梅根的紀念商品持續暢銷。觀光客搶購印上這對幸福小倆口的冰箱磁鐵、T恤、茶巾和杯具，為此掏出18美元或更多的錢。這場王室婚禮引領鋪天蓋地的皇家圖飾風潮，包括一些稀奇古怪的產品，例如哈利與梅根早餐穀片，顯然旨在輕鬆賺取近利。</p>

Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.</p>

自稱恐懼蜘蛛的克莉絲汀．巴納比，在北卡羅萊納州一家漢堡店找到了一種克服畏懼的方法。「我要把我的恐懼吃掉」，這個27歲的人於「水牛城漢堡釀酒廠」如是說，她在那裡嗑了一客上方蓋有一隻發育完全、被烤爐烘得脆脆的狼蛛的漢堡。在餐廳老闆賽斯．葛羅斯閱讀得知牠們被混鹽和糖去煮以及如何變成柬埔寨街頭主食後，狼蛛登場。這個狼蛛漢堡不是每個人都能享有。葛羅斯每年只拿到15隻養殖而來、有機培育的這種生物，所以用餐者得有好運與大膽，才能一嚐滋味。他說，「你進來，你簽樂透」，「如果我們抽到你的名字，你來拿一個去吃。」幸運得主們有長達48小時領取他們的獎品，而葛羅斯說，還沒有人抽腿過。（路透）</p>

Kristin Barnaby, a self-described arachnophobe, found a way to overcome what she dreads at a North Carolina burger joint.“I am going to eat my fear,” the 27-year-old said at the Bull City Burger and Brewery, where she tucked into a hamburger topped with a crunchy full-grown, oven-roasted tarantula.Tarantulas made their debut after restaurant owner Seth Gross read about how they have become a street food staple in Cambodia, where they are mixed with salt and sugar and cooked.The tarantula burger is not for everyone. Gross gets only 15 of the farmed, organically raised creatures each year, so diners need to be lucky, as well as daring, to get a taste.“You come in, you fill in a lottery ticket,” he said. “If we draw your name, you come and get to eat one.”The lucky winners have up to 48 hours to claim their prize and Gross said none have yet backed out.（Reuters）</p>

"In light of recent questions regarding my views on Women’s Rights, attached is my full statement," he posted on his verified "Courtland Sykes for Senate" Facebook page. On whether he favors women’s rights, Sykes said his fiancée, Chanel Rion, has given him orders to favor them, "so I’d better.""But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway：I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix after they become traditional homemakers and family wives," he said in the post.</p>

自1999年以來，超過10萬隻極度瀕危的紅毛猩猩在婆羅洲遭殺害，研究顯示。在該島進行16年調查的科學家形容，這個數字「令人難以接受」。因伐木、（種植）油棕、採礦以及造紙業而驅動的森林砍伐，仍是主要的罪魁禍首。然而，這份刊登在「當代生物學」期刊的研究也披露，該動物仍從森林覆蓋的地區「逐漸消失」。這意味著為數可觀的紅毛猩猩就是遭屠殺，首席研究員、德國「馬克斯．普朗克進化人類學研究所」的沃伊特說。她指出，紅毛猩猩被獵人鎖定並格殺，以報復其危害作物。英國利物浦約翰摩爾斯大學教授威齊指出：「當這些動物在種植園邊緣與人類發生衝突時，人們將殺掉牠們。就在上週，我們獲報有隻紅毛猩猩遭射殺，身上有130顆彈丸。」單是砍伐森林，便可能在未來35年進一步毀滅4萬5000隻紅毛猩猩。</p>

More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as "mind-boggling". Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit. But the research, published in the journal Current Biology, also revealed that animals were "disappearing" from areas that remained forested.This implied large numbers of orangutans were simply being slaughtered, said lead researcher Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. She said the animals are being targeted by hunters and are being killed in retaliation for crop-raiding.Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, UK said： "When these animals come into conflict with people on the edge of a plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we had a report of an orangutan that had 130 pellets in its body, after being shot."Deforestation alone could wipe out a further 45,000 orangutans over the next 35 years.</p>

More than 100,000 extremely endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, studies show. Scientists who surveyed the island for 16 years described the figure as "unacceptable." Deforestation, driven by logging, (planting) oil palm, mining and papermaking, remains the main culprit. However, the study published in the journal "Contemporary Biology" also revealed that the animal still "fades away" from the forest-covered areas. <strong>This means that a considerable number of orangutans are being slaughtered, says Voit, chief researcher and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</strong> She pointed out that the orangutans were locked and killed by hunters in retaliation for their dangerous crops. Professor Wesley of Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom pointed out: "When these animals collide with humans on the edge of the plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we were reported to have shot and killed only orangutans. "Single projectiles." The deforestation alone may destroy 45,000 orangutans further in the next 35 years.</p>

辣椒不只能讓嘴巴發疼，也可能造成頭痛。一名男子在食用被稱為全球最辣的辣椒後，頭痛欲裂到不得不去掛急診，而被記載於個案研究史冊。他的案例是迄今首例與吃辣椒有關的可逆性腦血管收縮症候群，即一種暫時性的腦動脈收縮，研究人員4月9日刊登在《英國醫學期刊病例報告》的研究指出。此類動脈收縮會導致劇烈疼痛，也被稱為「霹靂頭疼」，通常與妊娠併發症或使用違禁藥物有關。該名男子在吃辣椒比賽上食用被金氏世界紀錄評選為地表上最辣辣椒的「卡羅萊納死神」辣椒。卡羅萊納死神比「墨西哥辣椒」辣上逾200倍。他宣稱吃完辣椒1分鐘後便感到頭痛欲裂，而且在尋求治療之前，這種情況持續2天之久。初步檢查並未發現異狀。但該名男子的腦部血管電腦斷層掃描顯示，多處動脈出現收縮情況。研究人員5週後再次檢查其腦內影像時，則發現動脈已恢復原本大小。</p>

Competitors must create the most complex and gravity-defying artistic sculptures from rocks and pebbles gathered on the town’s Eye Cave Beach.

Stone stacking however has angered some conservationists who accuse enthusiasts of "rubbing out history" by removing rocks from ancient neolithic monuments.

Around a half a million participants enrolled in the study from 2006 to 2010 and have had their health tracked ever since. In the current study, the researchers specifically looked at over 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 to 73 who answered a question about whether they were a morning or evening type, then followed them for an average 6.5 years.Over 10,000 of those people died during the study period. And compared to people who described themselves as definite morning people, night owls were about 10 percent more likely to have died. More than that, night owls were also just generally unhealthier.According to the authors, it’s the first to suggest that gastrointestinal and neurological problems are more common among owls.</p>

Night owls can play better at parties, but their preference for staying up late may lead to several serious downsides, a new study published this week in the International Time Biology Journal points out. The researchers examined data from a continuously ongoing large UK resident population study "British Human Biological Database". From 2006 to 2010, about 500,000 people signed up to participate in the study and start tracking their health status. In this study, the researchers focused on more than 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 and 73 who had described themselves as morning-type or night-type people and tracked them on average for 6.5 years. <strong>During the study, more than 10,000 of these volunteers passed away.</strong> Compared with volunteers who have clearly described themselves as morning-wearers, the night owl’s death rate is about 10% higher. Not only that, night owls are also generally more unhealthy. The authors of the study pointed out that the study showed for the first time that night owls have more gastrointestinal and neurological problems.</p>

中國東北一位一直想要擁有一架飛機的男子，正進行退而求其次的方案：打造一架空中巴士A320噴射機的原尺寸仿製品。朱躍，一名擔任焊工和汽車技工的飛機迷，在他1年前和朋友們開始打造手工版本前，花了數個月研究飛機模型與工程製圖。40歲的朱躍住在遼寧省開原市，他說計畫把這架仿製品變身為一間飛機主題餐廳。他說：「我想確保這架飛機製造精美，並且是中國最棒的A320模型。」他補充，這件仿製品——37.8公尺長，翼展36公尺，以及12公尺高——將主打可旋轉的模型渦輪引擎以及模擬駕駛艙。朱躍至今已在他的計畫投入超過100萬人民幣積蓄及40公噸的鋼材，希望在年底前以總造價200萬人民幣完成它。（路透）</p>

A man in northeastern China who always wanted to own an aircraft is doing the next best thing：building a full-scale replica of an Airbus A320 jet.Zhu Yue, an aviation buff who worked as a welder and an auto mechanic, spent months studying plane models and technical drawings before he started building a homemade version a year ago with his friends.Zhu, 40, who lives in the city of Kaiyuan in Liaoning province, said he planned to turn the replica into an aviation-themed restaurant."I want to make sure the plane is created with finesse and be the best A320 model in China," he said.The replica - 37.8 meters long with a wingspan of 36 meters and height of 12 meters - will feature model engine turbines that can rotate and a simulation cockpit, he added.Zhu, who has so far spent more than 1 million yuan of his savings and used 40 tonnes of steel on his project, hopes to complete it by the end of year at a total cost of 2 million yuan. （Reuters）</p>

A man in northeastern China who has always wanted to own an aircraft is carrying out the next best solution: creating an original replica of an Airbus A320 jet. <strong>Zhu Yue, an aeroplane fan who worked as a welder and auto mechanic, spent a few months studying aircraft modelling and engineering drawing before he and his friends started making manual versions a year ago.</strong> Zhu Yue, 40, who lives in Kaiyuan, Liaoning Province, said that he plans to transform this imitation into an aircraft theme restaurant. He said: "I want to make sure that this aircraft is beautifully crafted and is the best A320 model in China." He added that this replica - 37.8 meters long, with a wingspan of 36 meters and a height of 12 meters - It will feature a rotating model turbine engine as well as a simulated cockpit. Zhu Yue has invested more than RMB 1 million in savings and 40 tons of steel in his plan so far and hopes to complete it by the end of the year at a total cost of RMB 2 million. (Reuters)</p>

一名（日本）高速新幹線子彈列車的駕駛員坦承，他在4月1日駛進JR仙台站時睡著，衝過停車點。這列東北新幹線列車以高於正常的速度抵達該站，迫使車掌啟動緊急煞車。根據負責營運的JR東日本鐵路公司仙台支社4月13日的說法，該列車最後在超出指定停車點20公尺處停下，還被迫倒車。起初，該名40幾歲的駕駛員表示，他弄錯了停車點。但在4月13日，他坦承當時在打瞌睡。該列車搭載約500名旅客，所幸無人因此受傷。仙台支社表示，這班「山彥」59號列車從東京出發，目的地是盛岡。此事發生在晚間約10時20分。</p>
