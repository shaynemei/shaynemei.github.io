&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops. The horse is showing you a mind that doesn’t stop, that is tormented," he says.（Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

西班牙文「國家報」報導，一名受到神職人員性侵犯的智利男子表示，教宗方濟各告訴他，天主造他為同志，也愛如此的他。性侵受害者胡安‧卡洛斯‧克魯茲告訴「國家報」，教宗在私下對話時告訴他：「你是同性戀並不重要。天主如此造你，也愛如此的你，我不會在乎。教宗愛如此的你，你必須對自己感到快樂。」&lt;/p&gt;

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest.

西班牙文「國家報」報導，一名受到神職人員性侵犯的智利男子表示，教宗方濟各告訴他，天主造他為同志，也愛如此的他。性侵受害者胡安‧卡洛斯‧克魯茲告訴「國家報」，教宗在私下對話時告訴他：「你是同性戀並不重要。天主如此造你，也愛如此的你，我不會在乎。教宗愛如此的你，你必須對自己感到快樂。」&lt;/p&gt;

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air.

But Seoul shouldered a greater cost given that the American troop number in Japan was more than double that in the South in 2015."Given the total number of troops, South Korea pays more in all spending categories than Japan to support the US forces," he said during a forum organized by Rep.

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;

法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）&lt;/p&gt;

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;

日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese railway company left the station 25 seconds earlier to cause the train to apologize for "any inconvenience". This is the second such incident in recent months. The train originally set off at Notogawa Station in Shiga Prefecture, Japan at 7:12 a.m. The conductor thought that the train should be separated at 7:11 a.m., so he closed the door early. &lt;strong&gt;At that time, although he found a mistake, he decided to leave because he saw no one on the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; Early driving did not affect the travel itinerary of any passengers, but there are still passengers wishing to catch a car. They complained to the railway operator "West Japan Railway Co., Ltd." that soon an official apology statement was issued. The Japanese train enjoys a reputation for being extremely punctual. A similar incident took place last fall, when a Tokyo-bound train to the eastern city of Tsukuba set off 20 seconds earlier, causing the operator, Tsukuba Express, to issue a public statement apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

In the heap of women, there is no single suitable man. &lt;strong&gt;The 30-year-old Noel said that he is eager to marry, but the long civil war in Syria has made potential pursuers either immigration or military, or they have been killed.&lt;/strong&gt; Syria was caught in a civil war after a large-scale demonstration broke out in 2011, when Noll was about to get his first degree in economi&lt;strong&gt;Afterwards, Noel chose to study for a second degree in literature at Damascus University&lt;/strong&gt;"I don't know how to pass the time.&lt;strong&gt;he time. There are no friends, no lover, no husband." Noel sighed and pulled away his hair dyed in gold. “I was afraid that Huafa would appear on my head before I got married.” In conservative Syrian society, women are usually expected to get married in their 20s, but these norms have been loosened due to the lack of suitable bachelors.

新研究揭露，每天吃香蕉可能有助於預防心臟病及中風。香蕉等富含鉀的食物，可防止致命心血管堵塞發生，並抑制動脈硬化及狹窄。阿拉巴馬大學研究人員分析具心臟病風險的老鼠。這些老鼠被餵食低、中或高水平的鉀，結果顯示給予低鉀飲食的老鼠動脈顯著硬化。對照之下，餵食高鉀的老鼠較少動脈硬化。 這種重要的礦物質—土豆、花椰菜及豆芽也富含—被發現有助於血液流入心臟及大腦，並可降低血栓風險。其他富含這種礦物質的食物，還包括防風草、種子、魚類及家禽等。然而，食用過多的鉀可能導致胃痛、噁心及腹瀉。老年人的危險性可能更高，因為他們的腎臟可能比較無法排除血液中的鉀。&lt;/p&gt;

New research reveals eating bananas every day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. High in potassium, foods like bananas can stop fatal blockages from occurring and inhibit the hardening and narrowing of arteries. Researchers at the University of Alabama analyzed mice who were at risk of heart disease. The mice were fed either low, normal or high levels of potassium with the results showing that the arteries of mice fed a low-potassium diet became significantly harder. In contrast, the mice given high potassium had less artery hardening.The vital mineral － which spuds, broccoli and sprouts are also rich in － was found to aid blood flow to the heart and brain and reduce the risk of clots. Other foods rich in the mineral include parsnips, seeds, fish and poultry.However, eating too much potassium can cause stomach ache, nausea and diarrhea. Older people may be more at risk because their kidneys may be less able to remove potassium from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A collection manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science, when updating the electronic system catalog, discovered this "real" pale yellow egg in more than 1,000 egg collections."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

The museum member took the egg to the Department of Art and Repair at the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he received radiography, a technique for examining the interior of the item through X-rays. This test not only confirms their guess but also shows the "white point" indicating that the egg has been fertiliz&lt;strong&gt;According to museum records, a former librarian bought the elephant egg at $92 from a hand-made specimen maker in London in 1939.&lt;/strong&gt;939.

紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs.

瑪索梅．阿堤被公公朝臉上潑酸而失明，但她不想只因為曾遭到邪惡對待，而被人們記住。她想成為一名藝術家。8年前，這名35歲的伊朗婦女永久性毀容，只因為她提出離婚。由於伊朗厲行伊斯蘭教律法，她從未獲得平反。最後，夫家還威脅，若她提出告訴，她的兒子將遭到相同懲罰。她說：「我選擇了兒子，而非正義。」但她也說，她已放下這個令人痛心疾首的決定，拒絕因為這個決定而精神崩潰。最近，她參加一個由其他潑酸受害者組成的團體，一起在德黑蘭一家藝廊展出作品，以提升社會關注及募款。阿堤創作陶器，雕刻碗盆和雕塑品。逃家後，她現在與12歲的兒子住在德黑蘭，為其他失明者上藝術課。她自豪地說，自己已「完全獨立」。&lt;/p&gt;

And in the end, the family threatened that the same punishment would befall her son if she pressed charges."I chose my son over justice," she said － a terrible choice she says she has put behind her and refuses to let crush her spirit.Recently, she joined a group of other victims of acid attacks presenting their work at a gallery in Tehran to raise awareness and money. Attaie makes pottery, sculpted bowls and statuettes.She now lives in Tehran with her 12-year-old son, having fled her family, gives art classes to other blind people and proudly says she is "totally independent".&lt;/p&gt;

Marsomer. Adi was blinded by his father-in-law, but she did not want to be remembered for being treated only by evil. She wants to be an artist. Eight years ago, the 35-year-old Iranian woman was permanently disfigured simply because she had filed a divorce. Since Iran’s strict implementation of Islamic law, she has never been rehabilitated. In the end, the husband’s family also threatened that if she offered to tell, her son would suffer the same punishment. She said: "I chose my son, not justice." But she also said that she had let go of this heartbreaking decision and refused to collapse because of this decision. &lt;strong&gt;Recently, she participated in a group of victims of other acid abuse, exhibiting works together at a gallery in Tehran to raise social concerns and fundraising.&lt;/strong&gt; Adi created pottery, carved bowls and sculptures. After fleeing from home, she now lives in Tehran with her 12-year-old son and gives art classes to other blind people. She said proudly that she was "completely independent."&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.&lt;/p&gt;

和他以迴避搭機聞名的獨裁者父親不同，北韓領導人金正恩搭機前往中國東北部城市大連，成為32年來首位搭機出訪的北韓統治者。自2011年底執政以來，金正恩偶爾會在北韓國內搭乘飛機。最近這趟（訪中）海外行程，儘管（地點）距離北韓邊界不遠，時間點落在他與美國總統唐納．川普會面、以解決北韓核武問題為主旨的高峰會之前。金正恩曾在瑞士求學多年，據信在青少年時期經常搭機。成為北韓領導人後，（北韓）國營媒體說，金正恩曾搭乘「蒼鷹1號」校閱參與空中戰鬥競賽的空軍機隊，與視察平壤的建設工程。北韓媒體發佈的照片也顯示，金正恩坐在專機內朝窗外看、步下專機階梯，以及與妻子李雪主聯袂踏上機場跑道的紅地毯。（美聯社）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Different from his dictator father, who is known for avoiding flights, North Korean leader Kim Jung-un took a plane to Dalian, the northeastern city of China, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly in 32 years. &lt;strong&gt;Since taking office in late 2011, Kim Jong-un occasionally flies in North Korea&lt;/strong&gt;Recently this trip (visiting China) overseas trip, although (location) not far from the North Korean border, the time point fell on him and US President Donner.**ner. Trump met before the summit aimed at resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. Kim Jong-un had studied in Switzerland for many years and he is believed to have frequent flights during his youth. After becoming a North Korean leader, the (North Korea) state-run media said that Kim Jong-un had used "Goshawk 1" to read the air force fleet participating in the air combat competition and to inspect the construction project in Pyongyang. Photographs released by North Korean media also show Kim Jong-un sitting in the plane, looking out of the window, stepping down the plane, and joining his wife Li Xue’s red carpet on the airport runway.

和他以迴避搭機聞名的獨裁者父親不同，北韓領導人金正恩搭機前往中國東北部城市大連，成為32年來首位搭機出訪的北韓統治者。自2011年底執政以來，金正恩偶爾會在北韓國內搭乘飛機。最近這趟（訪中）海外行程，儘管（地點）距離北韓邊界不遠，時間點落在他與美國總統唐納．川普會面、以解決北韓核武問題為主旨的高峰會之前。金正恩曾在瑞士求學多年，據信在青少年時期經常搭機。成為北韓領導人後，（北韓）國營媒體說，金正恩曾搭乘「蒼鷹1號」校閱參與空中戰鬥競賽的空軍機隊，與視察平壤的建設工程。北韓媒體發佈的照片也顯示，金正恩坐在專機內朝窗外看、步下專機階梯，以及與妻子李雪主聯袂踏上機場跑道的紅地毯。（美聯社）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）&lt;/p&gt;

Different from his dictator father, who is known for avoiding flights, North Korean leader Kim Jung-un took a plane to Dalian, the northeastern city of China, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly in 32 years. &lt;strong&gt;Since taking office in late 2011, Kim Jong-un occasionally flies in North Korea&lt;/strong&gt;Recently this trip (visiting China) overseas trip, although (location) not far from the North Korean border, the time point fell on him and US President Donner.**ner. Trump met before the summit aimed at resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. Kim Jong-un had studied in Switzerland for many years and he is believed to have frequent flights during his youth. After becoming a North Korean leader, the (North Korea) state-run media said that Kim Jong-un had used "Goshawk 1" to read the air force fleet participating in the air combat competition and to inspect the construction project in Pyongyang. Photographs released by North Korean media also show Kim Jong-un sitting in the plane, looking out of the window, stepping down the plane, and joining his wife Li Xue’s red carpet on the airport runway.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"In most Western countries, it seems common for workers to spend lunch breaks in the gym, but in Sweden, some employers have extended their thinking to make the sport an obligation to work."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

在多數西方國家，勞工在健身房度過午休時間，似乎司空見慣，但在瑞典，有些雇主延伸思考，讓運動成為工作上的義務。每週五，瑞典運動服飾零售商「比約恩．柏格」的員工，都會離開斯德哥爾摩公司總部的辦公室，到附近一間健身房進行每週運動。沒有人可以例外，因為這間由瑞典網球傳奇人物比約恩．柏格創立的公司，2年多來貫徹體態宛如摔角選手的44歲執行長漢瑞克．邦吉的倡議，強制要求員工在工作時間運動。「如果你不想運動，或不願融入企業文化，你就必須離開。」邦吉眼睛眨也不眨地說。他還提到，迄今沒有任何人因為這項要求而辭職。這項政策的主要目標，是希望在提高生產力和利潤之外，也能增進同事間的情誼。&lt;/p&gt;

Workers spending their lunch break at the gym may be commonplace in most Western countries, but in Sweden some employers are pushing the idea even further, making on-the-job exercise compulsory.Every Friday, employees of fashion and sportswear retailer Bjorn Borg leave their desks at the company’s Stockholm headquarters to get their weekly workout at a nearby gym.There is no getting out of it：for more than two years the company founded by the Swedish tennis legend has made on-the-job exercise mandatory at the initiative of chief executive Henrik Bunge, a 44-year-old built like a wrestler."If you don’t want to exercise or be a part of the company culture, you have to go," says Bunge, without batting an eye. So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A Japanese railway company left the station 25 seconds earlier to cause the train to apologize for "any inconvenience"."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again.&lt;/p&gt;

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again.&lt;/p&gt;

古根漢博物館總館長回覆白宮的電子郵件很有禮貌，但立場也很堅定：該館無法應允出借一幅梵谷的畫作，讓川普總統與第一夫人梅蘭妮亞掛在私人起居區的要求。取而代之的是，館長南西．史貝克特寫道，另一件藝術創作倒是可以出借，但該作品與描繪一名戴黑帽的男子，沿著法國阿爾勒的小徑遛狗的1888年梵谷畫作「雪景」，毫無相似之處。館長的替代方案是：1個18K、功能完備的黃金馬桶—一件名為「美國」、被批評者形容為尖銳諷刺美國財富過剩的互動式作品。&lt;/p&gt;

The emailed response from the Guggenheim’s chief curator to the White House was polite but firm：The museum could not accommodate a request to borrow a painting by Vincent van Gogh for President and Melania Trump’s private living quarters.Instead, wrote the curator, Nancy Spector, another piece was available, one that was nothing like "Landscape With Snow," the 1888 van Gogh rendering of a man in a black hat walking along a path in Arles, France, with his dog.The curator’s alternative： an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet — an interactive work titled "America" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed at the excess of wealth in this country.For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited "America" — the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan — in a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor for visitors to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Syria was caught in a civil war after a large-scale demonstration broke out in 2011, when Noll was about to get his first degree in economics."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
敘利亞學生諾爾若有所思地看著自己空無一物的無名指，接著掃視大馬士革大學裡的同班同學。在女人堆中，遍尋不著一名合適的單身男子。30歲的諾爾說自己很渴望婚姻，但敘利亞漫長的內戰，讓潛在的追求者不是移民、從軍，就是已一命嗚呼。敘利亞在2011年爆發大規模示威後陷入內戰，當時諾爾即將取得第一個經濟學學位。之後，諾爾選擇在大馬士革大學攻讀第二個文學學位。「我不知道如何打發時間。沒有朋友、沒有情人、也沒有丈夫。」諾爾一邊感嘆，一邊撥開染成金黃色的秀髮。「我很害怕在我出嫁前，頭上就出現華髮。」在保守的敘利亞社會，女性通常被期待20幾歲就結婚，但由於欠缺合適的單身漢，這些規範已有所鬆動。大馬士革心理學教授薩朗．卡瑟姆說：「女性現在就算在32歲結婚，也沒人會說她晚嫁了。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Syrian student Nour wistfully examines her bare ring finger, then scans fellow classmates around her at Damascus University. Amid the sea of women, there’s no eligible single man in sight.At 30, Nour says she is eager to get married － but Syria’s protracted conflict means potential suitors have emigrated, joined the army or lost their lives.Syria’s conflict erupted in 2011 with mass protests, just as Nour was preparing to graduate with her first degree in economics. Later Nour has opted to pursue her second degree at Damascus University in literature."I’ve got nothing to fill my time with. No friend, no lover, no husband," Nour sighs, pulling her dyed blonde hair away. "I’m terrified I’ll find a grey hair before I get married."In Syria’s conservative society, women were generally expected to marry in their 20s, but the lack of eligible bachelors has somewhat relaxed those norms."Now, a woman could marry at 32 without people saying she’s late to wed," said Salam Qassem, a psychology professor in Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Syrian student Noel thoughtfully looked at his empty ring finger and then glanced at fellow classmates at Damascus University. In the heap of women, there is no single suitable man. The 30-year-old Noel said that he is eager to marry, but the long civil war in Syria has made potential pursuers either immigration or military, or they have been killed. &lt;strong&gt;Syria was caught in a civil war after a large-scale demonstration broke out in 2011, when Noll was about to get his first degree in economics.&lt;/strong&gt; Afterwards, Noel chose to study for a second degree in literature at Damascus University. "I don't know how to pass the time. There are no friends, no lover, no husband." Noel sighed and pulled away his hair dyed in gold. “I was afraid that Huafa would appear on my head before I got married.” In conservative Syrian society, women are usually expected to get married in their 20s, but these norms have been loosened due to the lack of suitable bachelors. Damascus psychology professor Salang. Casem said: "Women are now married at 32, and no one will say she was married late."&lt;/p&gt;

紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. The needs of friendship. The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. &lt;strong&gt;However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch.&lt;/strong&gt; People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.&lt;/p&gt;

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest.

地球的大氣中，無時無刻都含有約13兆公升的水蒸氣，相當於地表上所有淡水資源的10%。一款新開發的吸附劑近來顯示，即便相對濕度降至約10%，它也能從大氣中收穫水汽。在這種條件下，每100萬公升的空氣可產出約3公升的水。這款概念驗證裝置由美國麻省理工學院、加州大學柏克萊分校的協同團隊研發，使用柏克萊化學系教授奧馬．亞吉在1990年代發明的一種「金屬有機骨架（MOF）」材料。化學家利用金屬和有機分子，控制能與「金屬有機骨架」結合的氣體種類及其鍵結強度。該裝置本身可簡單分為兩個主要部分：吸收層（又稱MOF）和作為空氣冷凝器的封套。MOF的背面會塗成黑色，用來吸收太陽能。&lt;/p&gt;

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.&lt;/p&gt;

The Earth’s atmosphere contains about 13 trillion liters of water vapor at all times, which is equivalent to 10% of all freshwater resources on the surface. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that even if relative humidity drops to about 10%, it can also harvest moisture from the atmosphere. Under this condition, about 3 liters of water can be produced per one million liters of air. This proof-of-concept device was developed by a collaborative team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California, Berkeley, using the Berkeley chemistry professor Omar. &lt;strong&gt;Yagi invented a metal-organic framework (MOF) material in the 1990s.&lt;/strong&gt; Chemists use metals and organic molecules to control the types of gases that can bind to "metal organic frameworks" and their bonding strength. The device itself can be simply divided into two main parts: the absorber layer (also known as MOF) and the envelope as an air condenser. The back of the MOF will be painted black to absorb solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;

So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

In most Western countries, it seems common for workers to spend lunch breaks in the gym, but in Sweden, some employers have extended their thinking to make the sport an obligation to work. Every Friday, employees of the Swedish sportswear retailer "Bjorn Berger" leave the office of the Stockholm company headquarters and go to a nearby gym for weekly exercise. No one can make exceptions because this is hosted by the Swedish tennis legend Bjorn. Berger founded the company and has been performing as a wrestler as the 44-year-old CEO Hankler in more than two years. Bunge's initiative forced employees to exercise during work hours. "If you don't want to exercise or you don't want to integrate into corporate culture, you have to leave." Bunge said with no embarrassment. He also mentioned that so far no one has resigned because of this request. &lt;strong&gt;The main goal of this policy is to increase the friendship between colleagues in addition to increasing productivity and profits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese railway company left the station 25 seconds earlier to cause the train to apologize for "any inconvenience". &lt;strong&gt;This is the second such incident in recent months.&lt;/strong&gt; The train originally set off at Notogawa Station in Shiga Prefecture, Japan at 7:12 a.m. The conductor thought that the train should be separated at 7:11 a.m., so he closed the door early. At that time, although he found a mistake, he decided to leave because he saw no one on the platform. Early driving did not affect the travel itinerary of any passengers, but there are still passengers wishing to catch a car. They complained to the railway operator "West Japan Railway Co., Ltd." that soon an official apology statement was issued. The Japanese train enjoys a reputation for being extremely punctual. A similar incident took place last fall, when a Tokyo-bound train to the eastern city of Tsukuba set off 20 seconds earlier, causing the operator, Tsukuba Express, to issue a public statement apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;

According to a study published on Tuesday (May 1st), wood frogs will keep urinating throughout the winter and survive through the recovery of urea. &lt;strong&gt;(U.S.) Alaskan wood frogs can not urinate for 8 months.&lt;/strong&gt; Now scientists have figured out what they did; more precisely, how they survived without urinating. The research report published in the "Royal Society Report Biosciences" magazine pointed out that the frog's intestine has special microorganisms that can recover urea, which is the main waste in urine. By recycling urea into useful nitrogen, this frog can sustain its life during hibernation and freezing. Although recycled urea cannot warm the body, it protects cells and tissues even when their heart, brain, and blood flow cease to functi&lt;strong&gt;The temperature of the Alaskan wood frog can be reduced to zero temperatures&lt;/strong&gt;Once close to spring and temperature rises, the frogs will return to life; after they thaw, they begin eating and mating again.**g again.&lt;/p&gt;

袋鼠是澳洲觀光引人入勝的要角之一，但一家公園的遊客所獲超乎了他們所求。距離雪梨有兩小時火車路程的麥覺理湖市觀光客忽略警示，餵袋鼠吃紅蘿蔔，牠們一看到最愛之含糖零食就變得具有攻擊性。受到保證「可愛野生袋鼠」是「溫馴到可以靠近及一起拍照」的眾多旅遊部落格誘惑，每週有數千人蜂擁來看一家精神病院附近草坡上的袋鼠。手裡拿紅蘿蔔，遊客接近袋鼠，想和澳洲象徵來個自拍。但結局並非一向美好。一張貼到臉書的照片顯示，一隻袋鼠跳起來，用牠有力的腿踢了一名遊客。其他照片顯示，一名婦女臉遭抓傷，一名男子流血破肚。經營到這處公園觀光巴士服務的謝恩．路易斯告訴路透，「不論在什麼情境下，袋鼠可能偶爾具有侵略性，但九成是試著餵牠們的民眾被攻擊。」&lt;/p&gt;

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

The kangaroo is one of the most important cornerstones of Australian tourism, but visitors to a park have exceeded what they asked for. Tourists in Lake Macquarie who are two hours by train from Sydney ignore warnings and feed kangaroos to eat carrots. Once they see their favorite sugary snacks, they become aggressive. The guaranteed "Cute Wild Kangaroo" is a temptation to "tremendously can be approached and photographed" by many travel bloggers. Thousands of people flock to the kangaroos on a grassy slope near a mental hospital every week. With carrots in hand, visitors approached Kangaroo and wanted to take a selfie with the Australian symbol. But the outcome is not always beautiful. A photo posted on Facebook shows a kangaroo jumping up and kicking a visitor with his strong legs. Other photos showed a woman's face was scratched and a man was bleeding. &lt;strong&gt;Sheen, who runs this park sightseeing bus service.&lt;/strong&gt; Louis told Reuters, "While in any situation, kangaroos may occasionally be aggressive, but 90% of the people who try to feed them are attacked."&lt;/p&gt;

新研究揭露，每天吃香蕉可能有助於預防心臟病及中風。香蕉等富含鉀的食物，可防止致命心血管堵塞發生，並抑制動脈硬化及狹窄。阿拉巴馬大學研究人員分析具心臟病風險的老鼠。這些老鼠被餵食低、中或高水平的鉀，結果顯示給予低鉀飲食的老鼠動脈顯著硬化。對照之下，餵食高鉀的老鼠較少動脈硬化。 這種重要的礦物質—土豆、花椰菜及豆芽也富含—被發現有助於血液流入心臟及大腦，並可降低血栓風險。其他富含這種礦物質的食物，還包括防風草、種子、魚類及家禽等。然而，食用過多的鉀可能導致胃痛、噁心及腹瀉。老年人的危險性可能更高，因為他們的腎臟可能比較無法排除血液中的鉀。&lt;/p&gt;

New research reveals eating bananas every day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. High in potassium, foods like bananas can stop fatal blockages from occurring and inhibit the hardening and narrowing of arteries. Researchers at the University of Alabama analyzed mice who were at risk of heart disease. The mice were fed either low, normal or high levels of potassium with the results showing that the arteries of mice fed a low-potassium diet became significantly harder. In contrast, the mice given high potassium had less artery hardening.The vital mineral － which spuds, broccoli and sprouts are also rich in － was found to aid blood flow to the heart and brain and reduce the risk of clots. Other foods rich in the mineral include parsnips, seeds, fish and poultry.However, eating too much potassium can cause stomach ache, nausea and diarrhea. Older people may be more at risk because their kidneys may be less able to remove potassium from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

These mice were fed low, medium, or high levels of potassium, and the results showed that the mouse arteries given a low potassium diet hardened.

新研究揭露，每天吃香蕉可能有助於預防心臟病及中風。香蕉等富含鉀的食物，可防止致命心血管堵塞發生，並抑制動脈硬化及狹窄。阿拉巴馬大學研究人員分析具心臟病風險的老鼠。這些老鼠被餵食低、中或高水平的鉀，結果顯示給予低鉀飲食的老鼠動脈顯著硬化。對照之下，餵食高鉀的老鼠較少動脈硬化。 這種重要的礦物質—土豆、花椰菜及豆芽也富含—被發現有助於血液流入心臟及大腦，並可降低血栓風險。其他富含這種礦物質的食物，還包括防風草、種子、魚類及家禽等。然而，食用過多的鉀可能導致胃痛、噁心及腹瀉。老年人的危險性可能更高，因為他們的腎臟可能比較無法排除血液中的鉀。&lt;/p&gt;

New research reveals eating bananas every day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. High in potassium, foods like bananas can stop fatal blockages from occurring and inhibit the hardening and narrowing of arteries. Researchers at the University of Alabama analyzed mice who were at risk of heart disease.

On May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry. The couple will wed in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — a royal residence in the small town of Windsor some 22 miles west of central London.The bells of St. George’s will chime to mark the happy event, but the cash tills are already ringing. Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

（英國）哈利王子和梅根．馬克爾5月19日即將完婚。這對小倆口將在溫莎古堡的聖喬治禮拜堂結婚，那是一處皇家宅邸，位於距離倫敦市中心西方約22英里的一座小鎮內。聖喬治禮拜堂的鐘聲即將為這樁幸福大事敲響，但收銀台的鈴聲早已響起。觀光業是溫莎鎮迄今規模最大的產業。感謝王室家族，每年都有700萬名遊客結伴到訪這座小鎮，婚禮當天則預計再增加10萬訪客，帶動當地經濟。當地議會的副主席菲利普．比克內爾預期，會有許多出手闊綽的美國觀光客到訪。「美國人非常熱衷這場婚禮，因為終於有美國人即將成為王室一員。」比克內爾表示。坐落於溫莎古堡山腳下的「國王與王后禮物店」裡，哈利與梅根的紀念商品持續暢銷。觀光客搶購印上這對幸福小倆口的冰箱磁鐵、T恤、茶巾和杯具，為此掏出18美元或更多的錢。這場王室婚禮引領鋪天蓋地的皇家圖飾風潮，包括一些稀奇古怪的產品，例如哈利與梅根早餐穀片，顯然旨在輕鬆賺取近利。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry. The couple will wed in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — a royal residence in the small town of Windsor some 22 miles west of central London.The bells of St. George’s will chime to mark the happy event, but the cash tills are already ringing. Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

On May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry. The couple will wed in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — a royal residence in the small town of Windsor some 22 miles west of central London.The bells of St. George’s will chime to mark the happy event, but the cash tills are already ringing. Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

"In light of recent questions regarding my views on Women’s Rights, attached is my full statement," he posted on his verified "Courtland Sykes for Senate" Facebook page. On whether he favors women’s rights, Sykes said his fiancée, Chanel Rion, has given him orders to favor them, "so I’d better.""But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway：I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix after they become traditional homemakers and family wives," he said in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

自1999年以來，超過10萬隻極度瀕危的紅毛猩猩在婆羅洲遭殺害，研究顯示。在該島進行16年調查的科學家形容，這個數字「令人難以接受」。因伐木、（種植）油棕、採礦以及造紙業而驅動的森林砍伐，仍是主要的罪魁禍首。然而，這份刊登在「當代生物學」期刊的研究也披露，該動物仍從森林覆蓋的地區「逐漸消失」。這意味著為數可觀的紅毛猩猩就是遭屠殺，首席研究員、德國「馬克斯．普朗克進化人類學研究所」的沃伊特說。她指出，紅毛猩猩被獵人鎖定並格殺，以報復其危害作物。英國利物浦約翰摩爾斯大學教授威齊指出：「當這些動物在種植園邊緣與人類發生衝突時，人們將殺掉牠們。就在上週，我們獲報有隻紅毛猩猩遭射殺，身上有130顆彈丸。」單是砍伐森林，便可能在未來35年進一步毀滅4萬5000隻紅毛猩猩。&lt;/p&gt;

More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as "mind-boggling". Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit. But the research, published in the journal Current Biology, also revealed that animals were "disappearing" from areas that remained forested.This implied large numbers of orangutans were simply being slaughtered, said lead researcher Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. She said the animals are being targeted by hunters and are being killed in retaliation for crop-raiding.Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, UK said： "When these animals come into conflict with people on the edge of a plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we had a report of an orangutan that had 130 pellets in its body, after being shot."Deforestation alone could wipe out a further 45,000 orangutans over the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

More than 100,000 extremely endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, studies show. Scientists who surveyed the island for 16 years described the figure as "unacceptable." Deforestation, driven by logging, (planting) oil palm, mining and papermaking, remains the main culprit. However, the study published in the journal "Contemporary Biology" also revealed that the animal still "fades away" from the forest-covered areas. &lt;strong&gt;This means that a considerable number of orangutans are being slaughtered, says Voit, chief researcher and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/strong&gt; She pointed out that the orangutans were locked and killed by hunters in retaliation for their dangerous crops. Professor Wesley of Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom pointed out: "When these animals collide with humans on the edge of the plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we were reported to have shot and killed only orangutans. "Single projectiles." The deforestation alone may destroy 45,000 orangutans further in the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

The next time you feel stressed, grab a bar or two of chocolate - as new research suggests eating chocolate can actually help lower your stress levels.According to researchers at Loma Linda University in Southern California, consuming dark chocolate can have a positive effect on your brain health. They found that eating dark chocolate with a high percentage of cacao, typically chocolate over 70 per cent, reduces stress levels and inflammation.They also found eating dark chocolate improves your mood, memory and immunity - confirming chocolate is the greatest invention on the planet. Cacao contains flavonoids, which are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that can help both brain and cardiovascular health.Lead researcher Lee Berk said the higher the concentration of cacao, the more positive the impact on cognition, memory, mood and immunity but it is only dark chocolate that has the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

Hot peppers aren’t just a pain in the mouth — they may be a pain in the head, too. After eating the hottest known pepper in the world, a man suffered from splitting headaches that drove him to the hospital emergency room, and into case-study history.His is the first known instance of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome — a temporary narrowing of arteries in the brain — to be tied to eating a hot pepper, researchers report April 9 in British Medical Journal Case Reports. Such narrowed arteries can lead to severe pain called “thunderclap headaches” and are often associated with pregnancy complications or illicit drug use.During a hot-pepper-eating contest, the man ate a chili dubbed the Carolina Reaper, named by Guinness World Records as the hottest pepper in the world. The Carolina Reaper is over 200 times as spicy as a jalapeno. About a minute later, he reported experiencing splitting headaches that came and went over two days before he sought treatment.Initial tests failed to find anything out of the ordinary. But a CT scan of blood vessels in the man’s brain showed severely narrowed arteries. When the researchers imaged his brain five weeks later, the arteries had returned to their normal size.&lt;/p&gt;

The latest figure apparently reflects the people’s approval of the outcome of the inter-Korean summit.In a separate survey conducted by Realmeter, 71.4 percent of 501 respondents said they believe the North will actually denuclearize this time around in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way. The approval rating of the ruling Democratic Party also enjoyed a sharp increase, advancing 2.7 percentage points to 54.9 percent from a week earlier. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party’s rating, on the other hand, slipped 3.2 percentage points to 17.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

A poll released on Thursday showed that after the historic summit between South Korea’s President Wen Yat-sen and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Wen’s support rate shot up to an 11-month high this week. In a survey conducted by “Realmeter”, a polling agency in South Korea, 78.3% of respondents stated that they supported Wen’s administration. &lt;strong&gt;This latest poll figure clearly reflects the people's support for the results of the "World Finance Council".&lt;/strong&gt; In another survey conducted by Realmeter, 71.4% of the 501 respondents answered that it is believed that North Korea will be denuclearized in a completely, verifiable, and irreversible manner this time. The South Korean ruling party’s “Common Democrat” has also seen a significant increase in the support rate, which has increased by 2.7 percentage points from the previous week to 54.9%. On the other hand, the support rating of the largest opposition party, the “free Korean party”, fell 3.2% to 17.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

德國西部亞琛市的超級市場消費者踏出了他們的舒適圈，品嚐水牛蠕蟲製成的昆蟲漢堡。因蛋白質含量高而極度營養的這些蠕蟲，是水牛甲蟲的幼蟲，於荷蘭繁殖培育。用萵苣、洋蔥和蕃茄包捲上菜，在荷蘭和比利時證明成功後，它們被供應給亞琛一家超市的顧客。試過其中一個漢堡的路人曼弗雷德．勒德爾說，他相信它們是替代肉類的好選擇，並補充指出：「我最初持保留態度，但我吃了第二份，因為它吃起來好棒。」製作這些漢堡的新創公司「蟲蟲基金會」的成立者之一巴利斯．歐澤爾說，他花了4年時間和公司共同創辦人馬克斯．克拉瑪構思出這個概念。歐澤爾說，「相當簡單。你必須創造一個有美感的產品，好看但不要露出任何昆蟲」，並補充指出，人們受到這些漢堡味道的吸引。（路透）&lt;/p&gt;

Stone stacking however has angered some conservationists who accuse enthusiasts of "rubbing out history" by removing rocks from ancient neolithic monuments.

Night owls may be more fun at parties, but a preference for staying out late may come with some serious drawbacks, suggests a new study published this week in Chronobiology International.Researchers looked data from a large, ongoing population study of UK residents, known as the UK Biobank Study. Around a half a million participants enrolled in the study from 2006 to 2010 and have had their health tracked ever since. In the current study, the researchers specifically looked at over 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 to 73 who answered a question about whether they were a morning or evening type, then followed them for an average 6.5 years.Over 10,000 of those people died during the study period. And compared to people who described themselves as definite morning people, night owls were about 10 percent more likely to have died. More than that, night owls were also just generally unhealthier.According to the authors, it’s the first to suggest that gastrointestinal and neurological problems are more common among owls.&lt;/p&gt;

Night owls can play better at parties, but their preference for staying up late may lead to several serious downsides, a new study published this week in the International Time Biology Journal points out. The researchers examined data from a continuously ongoing large UK resident population study "British Human Biological Database". From 2006 to 2010, about 500,000 people signed up to participate in the study and start tracking their health status. In this study, the researchers focused on more than 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 and 73 who had described themselves as morning-type or night-type people and tracked them on average for 6.5 years. &lt;strong&gt;During the study, more than 10,000 of these volunteers passed away.&lt;/strong&gt; Compared with volunteers who have clearly described themselves as morning-wearers, the night owl’s death rate is about 10% higher. Not only that, night owls are also generally more unhealthy. The authors of the study pointed out that the study showed for the first time that night owls have more gastrointestinal and neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;

一名（日本）高速新幹線子彈列車的駕駛員坦承，他在4月1日駛進JR仙台站時睡著，衝過停車點。這列東北新幹線列車以高於正常的速度抵達該站，迫使車掌啟動緊急煞車。根據負責營運的JR東日本鐵路公司仙台支社4月13日的說法，該列車最後在超出指定停車點20公尺處停下，還被迫倒車。起初，該名40幾歲的駕駛員表示，他弄錯了停車點。但在4月13日，他坦承當時在打瞌睡。該列車搭載約500名旅客，所幸無人因此受傷。仙台支社表示，這班「山彥」59號列車從東京出發，目的地是盛岡。此事發生在晚間約10時20分。&lt;/p&gt;

查克．麥卡錫的散步服務以每小時30美元的價格，提供新鮮空氣、運動與同伴情誼—不過在樹旁撒尿可絕對不行。這位洛杉磯企業家作為該市第一個遛人公司的創辦人，是與人類配合工作，而非動物，並捍衛健康與社會包容。「我考慮成為一名遛狗師。但我未曾在這座城市養過狗。」麥卡錫說。「我也看到許多私人教練的廣告。因此我對女友說『或許我就成為遛人師』。」麥卡錫在說笑，但當他越加思考，就越了解有對他能提供的那種同伴之誼的需求。「遛人師」2年前以1人運作方式開始營運。但需求之高，致使麥卡錫現在值勤表上有35名陪走者，人們可在網站上選擇路線與步行夥伴。不是因為人們的朋友變少，專家說，而是「零工經濟」已產生一個自由工作者世代，相關工作沒有傳統上聯繫工作者的例行公事或社會連結。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. &lt;strong&gt;The needs of friendship.&lt;/strong&gt; The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch. People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.&lt;/p&gt;

法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
French President Emmanuel. Mark Macro went to Washington last week to conduct a state visit with Donner. President Trump planted a tree on the White House land to celebrate the special relationship between the United States and France. The oak seedling is now missing - at least for the time being. White House photographers noticed that the tree disappeared a few days after it was planted. &lt;strong&gt;The mystery goes up.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, the tree from France's Belo Forest - a battle in the First World War that killed nearly 2,000 soldiers in the United States - was dug shortly after being planted. According to US and French officials, it was quarantined. The problem lies in the fact that parasites in trees may spread to other trees on the White House estate. An official in Mark Hong’s office said: “Actually, the kind of tree that can be planted on the day of the president’s visit is a special courtesy to Trump by Trump.” (Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

古根漢博物館總館長回覆白宮的電子郵件很有禮貌，但立場也很堅定：該館無法應允出借一幅梵谷的畫作，讓川普總統與第一夫人梅蘭妮亞掛在私人起居區的要求。取而代之的是，館長南西．史貝克特寫道，另一件藝術創作倒是可以出借，但該作品與描繪一名戴黑帽的男子，沿著法國阿爾勒的小徑遛狗的1888年梵谷畫作「雪景」，毫無相似之處。館長的替代方案是：1個18K、功能完備的黃金馬桶—一件名為「美國」、被批評者形容為尖銳諷刺美國財富過剩的互動式作品。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The emailed response from the Guggenheim’s chief curator to the White House was polite but firm：The museum could not accommodate a request to borrow a painting by Vincent van Gogh for President and Melania Trump’s private living quarters.Instead, wrote the curator, Nancy Spector, another piece was available, one that was nothing like "Landscape With Snow," the 1888 van Gogh rendering of a man in a black hat walking along a path in Arles, France, with his dog.The curator’s alternative： an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet — an interactive work titled "America" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed at the excess of wealth in this country.For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited "America" — the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan — in a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor for visitors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The chief curator of the Guggenheim Museum responded politely to the White House’s e-mail, but his position was also firm: the museum could not obtain a copy of Van Gogh's paintings, allowing President Trump to hang in the private living area with First Lady Melanie. The request. &lt;strong&gt;Instead, the curator is Nanxi.&lt;/strong&gt; Shibike noted that another piece of art can be loaned, but the work is not similar to the depiction of a man wearing a black hat and painting the snow scene of the 1888 Van Gogh walking along the trail in Arles, Fran&lt;strong&gt;The place.&lt;/strong&gt;ace. The curator's alternative is: An 18K fully functional gold toilet - an interactive piece called "The United States" that critics describe as a sharp irony of American wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

When Lebanese chef Alan Geaam first arrived in Paris two decades ago he found himself sleeping on the streets, lost and penniless with hardly a word of French.Geaam, who began his career as a dishwasher, finally received his first Michelin star from the French gastronomic bible for his acclaimed new restaurant.In the childhood Geaam had a fascination with food, watching cookery shows on television rather than cartoons after school. He started cooking while doing his national service in Lebanon, and the colonel of his regiment was so impressed he made him his personal chef.But Geaam never thought he would be able to cut the mustard in France. "I worked during the day as a construction worker and at night delivering pizzas and washing dishes. One night the cook cut his hand and had to go to hospital. No one asked me, but I just took over. There were 14 tables and I just feed the customers and at the end of the night they were delighted."&lt;/p&gt;

Belfast man Melvin Boyd had fallen on hard times, but said once he met Pastor Greenaway’s family and began living with them, his life changed. In turn, Boyd changed a life when he offered the pastor, who needed an organ transplant, one of his kidneys.Boyd said living on the streets was difficult and that he could not trust anyone. After meeting the pastor’s son, who brought him to the family home, the Greenaway family helped Boyd to beat his alcohol addiction and start over.Pastor Greenaway said： "I believed Melvin needed a new start in life, we wanted to help him" Since then, Boyd has stayed at the family home every day and night, and has become another son to the pastor, and his wife, who already have four children.Last March, he repaid the pastor for his generosity by donating one of his kidneys to him.

JPSS-1正式以NOAA-20的身分與大家見面。不過，以JPSS-1為首的一系列衛星仍然稱為JPSS系列。依循往例，美國國家海洋暨大氣總署（NOAA）在策劃、設計與建造繞極衛星時，會分派字母（A、B、C…）區別每顆衛星。而當衛星發射升空抵達運行軌道時，會再分派數字編號。「聯合極軌衛星系統」的繞極衛星（JPSS-1、JPSS-2、JPSS-3、JPSS-4）有些許不同。它們在建造、測試與發射階段就被分派數字，而未使用字母。儘管如此，它們抵達運行軌道時，還是會成為NOAA-20、NOAA-21、NOAA-22、NOAA-23。為什麼要從「JPSS」改名為「NOAA」？根據NOAA文獻，改名可延續命名規則的一致性；除NOAA與美國國家航太總署（NASA）的「索米國家極軌夥伴關係」（Suomi NPP）衛星外，該機構自1978年以來，便遵循這項繞極衛星的命名規則。&lt;/p&gt;

JPSS-1 officially became known as NOAA-20. However, the entire series of satellites, of which JPSS-1 is the first, is still referred to as the JPSS series.Traditionally, when NOAA’s polar-orbiting satellites were planned, designed and built, NOAA assigned each one with a letter (-A, -B, -C …). Then, when the satellite reached orbit after launch, it was given a number. The polar-orbiting satellites of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1, -2, -3, and -4) are a bit different. Instead of letters, they are designated by numbers during their construction, testing, and launch phases. However, they still become NOAA-20, -21, -22, and -23 when they attain orbit. Why will their names change from "JPSS" to "NOAA"? According to NOAA documentation, the change is to maintain consistency in naming conventions that NOAA has followed since 1978 for polar-orbiting satellites, except for the NOAA-NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (Suomi NPP).&lt;/p&gt;

JPSS-1 officially met with everyone as NOAA-20. However, a series of satellites headed by JPSS-1 are still called the JPSS series. Following the example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States will assign letters (A, B, C...) to distinguish each satellite when planning, designing, and constructing the orbiting satellite. When the satellite launches into orbit and arrives at the orbit, it will be assigned a numerical number. &lt;strong&gt;The circumpolar satellites (JPSS-1, JPSS-2, JPSS-3, and JPSS-4) of the "Unipolar Orbital Satellite System" are slightly different.&lt;/strong&gt; They are assigned numbers during the construction, testing, and launch phases without the use of letters. However, when they reach the orbit, they will still become NOAA-20, NOAA-21, NOAA-22, NOAA-23. Why did you change from "JPSS" to "NOAA"?

For the first time, strange alien ice has been seen forming on Earth by US researchers. This revelation was made by the researchers at Stanford University on July 8, 2017. The researchers dubbed the alien ice as ice seven, which forms naturally in the environment when planetary ice bodies collide."These experiments with water are the first of their kind, allowing us to witness a fundamental disorder-to-order transition in one of the most abundant molecules in the universe," said study lead author Arianna Gleason, a visiting scientist in the Extreme Environments Laboratory of Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Sciences.Most powerful X-ray lasers were used by the researchers to create ice VII with the help of Linac Coherent Light Source. Another instrument called X-ray Free Electron Laser is used to beam the compressed water. This transformation took place in just six billionths of a second, or nanoseconds during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

Pope Francis has called for a translation of a phrase about temptation in the Lord’s Prayer to be changed.

His suggestion is to use "do not let us fall into temptation" instead, he told Italian TV.The Lord’s Prayer is the best-known prayer in Christianity. The pontiff said France’s Roman Catholic Church was now using the new wording "do not let us fall into temptation" as an alternative, and something similar should be used worldwide."Do not let me fall into temptation because it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation and then sees how I fell," he said. "A father does not do that, a father helps you to get up immediately."It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, a 4th-Century Latin translation of the Bible, which itself was translated from ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.Since the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has not shied away from controversy and has tackled some issues head-on. He has previously said the Roman Catholic Church should apologise to gay people for the way it has treated them.&lt;/p&gt;

Astronomers have identified the smallest star ever discovered in the Universe and said that it could help in the search for Earth-like planets that may have the potential for life.The star is located 600 light years away and is just larger than Saturn. The radius of Saturn is around 9.5 times that of Earth, but stars are generally much larger than planets.Named EBLM J0555-57Ab, the newly-identified star has a gravitational pull around 300 times stronger than that on Earth. Its radius is 8.4 percent and mass 8.1 percent the size of that of the Sun.It is likely that the newly-identified star is as small as a star can possibly become. Stars require a certain level of mass to enable hydrogen fusion to take place at their cores. Were the star in question to be any smaller, it would not likely have the requisite mass to sustain the nuclear fusion. It would have instead become a brown dwarf, celestial objects that are bigger than giant planets but smaller than the smallest stars and emit infrared radiation, said Alexander Boetticher of the University of Cambridge, the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

The 115-year-old botanical wonder - known as Lady Cynthia - will carry about 4,000 spring blossoms over the next couple of weeks. The rhododendron is often confused for a tree but is actually a shrub.The local historian Rob Johnson, 73, has convinced the town’s Chamber of Commerce to promote "the marvel of nature" as an attraction. "It’s the size of a small house and is a vibrant pink colour," said Johnson. When it is not in bloom, he says it is "just a nice, big, green shrub". He said he realised "we should capitalise on this" when he saw the rhododendron attracting comment online.Local residents in the town of 8,100 have grown accustomed to the huge shrub, which has been in Ladysmith since around 1904. The first owners of the property are said to have brought Lady Cynthia to the forestry community on a sailing ship from Scotland. Ladysmith’s rhododendron is so named because it is a Cynthia hybrid of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

在週三晚間本季首場主場比賽開打前，（美國俄亥俄州）肯特州立大學籃球隊以自己的方式重新定義賽前唱國歌儀式：每名球員走入觀眾席邀請一名跟自己不同種族的球迷到球場上與之並肩而立。「我們的球員得鼓起勇氣，才能做這樣的表態，我深信這展現出我們校園社區的團結，」教練羅伯‧山德拉夫告訴美聯社。「有很多人在抗議國歌、大選或宗教，全國各地都有，而我們的球員也想表態。對我而言，這是很正面的表態，希望能獲得所有人的認同。」根據校方發言人尤金‧坎奈爾，此舉非常奏效，因為觀眾完全沒料到。「這很酷，因為我不覺得觀眾席上有人知道將發生什麼事。沒有球迷事先知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

Before its first home game of the season tipped off on Wednesday night, the Kent State men’s basketball put its own spin on the national anthem: Each player went up into the crowd and invited a fan of a different race down to the court to stand with them."It takes courage for our players to make a statement like this, and I believe it is a representation of the unity in our campus community," Coach Rob Senderoff told the Associated Press. "There’s a lot of people protesting the national anthem, or protesting the election, or religion. You see all of that nationally, and our guys wanted to make a statement. To me, it was a tremendously positive statement. Hopefully everybody can recognize that."According to school spokesman Eugene Canal, the gesture was so effective because no one in the crowd expected it."It was cool because I don’t think anyone in the crowd knew what was going on. None of the fans knew about it beforehand."&lt;/p&gt;

Before the start of the first home game of the season on Wednesday night, the Kent State University basketball team redefines the pre-competition singing national anthem in their own way: Each player enters the auditorium and invites a different race from himself. Fans stand side by side with the court. "Our players must have the courage to make such a statement. I am convinced that this shows the unity of our campus community," coach Robert Hillradoff told the Associated Press. "A lot of people are protesting the national anthem, the general election or religion. &lt;strong&gt;There are all over the country.&lt;/strong&gt; Our players also want to make a statement. To me, this is a very positive statement and I hope to get everyone's approval." According to the school spokesman Eugene Cannell, this move was very effective because the audience did not expect it. "It's cool because I don't think anyone in the audience knows what will happen. No fans know in advance."&lt;/p&gt;

在可追溯至聖經時代的傳統，「非洲之角」索馬利蘭崎嶇的馬多山脈間，男人黎明起身，攀爬岩塊，尋找野生乳香樹的珍貴露頭。經乾燥並點燃，乳香樹汁液產生的芬芳香氣，全世界教堂、清真寺都因此薰香。乳香，與黃金、沒藥，是三位王者給耶穌誕生之福音所帶來的禮物。然而，現在地球最後一片完整野生乳香樹林，正因近年全球追求精油導致的價格飆升而瀕危。過度採收讓乳香樹的死亡速度更甚於再生，古老的樹脂貿易因此陷入危境。採集乳香極具風險。乳香樹能在懸崖邊緣長到很高，淺淺的根部緊抓著有毒蛇蜿蜒爬行在上的裸岩。採集者經常失足，沿峽谷山壁滾跌下去。收集到樹脂後，婦女依樹脂塊的顏色、尺寸排序。各類樹脂運至葉門、沙烏地阿拉伯，最終到歐洲與美洲。在製香之外，乳香膠可提煉製作香水的用油、護膚乳液、藥品及口香糖。&lt;/p&gt;

In a tradition dating to Biblical times, men rise at dawn in the rugged Cal Madow mountains of Somaliland in the Horn of Africa to scale rocky outcrops in search of the prized sap of wild frankincense trees.When dried and burned, the sap produces a fragrant smoke which perfumes churches and mosques around the world. Frankincense, along with gold and myrrh, was brought by the Three Kings as gifts in the Gospel account of the birth of Jesus.But now these last intact wild frankincense forests on Earth are under threat as prices have shot up in recent years with the global appetite for essential oils. Overharvesting has led to the trees dying off faster than they can replenish, putting the ancient resin trade at risk.Harvesting frankincense is risky. The trees can grow high on cliff edges, shallow roots gripping bare rock slithering with venomous snakes. Harvesters often slip and tumble down canyon walls.Once the resin is collected, women sort the chunks by color and size. The various classes of resin are shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually Europe and America. Besides its use as incense, frankincense gum is distilled into oil for use in perfumes, skin lotions, medicine and chewing gum.&lt;/p&gt;

In the tradition dating back to the biblical age, the “horn of Africa” in the rugged Madonna mountains of Somalialand, the men got up at dawn and climbed the rock to find the precious outcrop of the wild mastic trees. After drying and igniting, the fragrant odor produced by the frankincense tree sap, the churches and mosques all over the world are scented. The frankincense, with gold and myrrh, is the gift of the three kings to the gospel of the birth of Jesus. However, the last complete wild frankincense grove in the earth is currently endangered by the soaring price of global essential oils in recent years. Over-harvesting causes the death rate of Frankincense trees to grow even faster than regeneration, and the ancient resin trade is in danger. &lt;strong&gt;Collecting frankincense is extremely risky.&lt;/strong&gt; The frankincense tree grows very high on the edge of the cliff, and the shallow roots cling to the bare rock that the viper snake crawls on. Collectors often slipped and fell down the canyon wall. After the resin was collected, the women were sorted by the color and size of the resin block. All types of resins were shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually to Europe and the Americas. In addition to making incense, mastic gum can be used to make oils, skin care lotions, medicines and chewing gums for perfumes.&lt;/p&gt;

據一項報告，每3人中有1人沉迷於手機，夜晚總會不斷查看。如果你是18至24歲的族群，比例更上升為2人中就有1人。此舉看似無害，實則非常有殺傷力。睡眠專家已再三警告，晚上盯著手機會傷及健康。這和手機螢幕放射的藍光有莫大關係。藍光會讓我們的身體誤以為現在是白天；換句話說，即便我們再度入睡，睡眠品質也會大幅降低。這項研究指出，「智慧型手機讓人們可以追蹤現在發生什麼事、人們說了什麼話，以及大家上傳什麼東西。這些事你可以在白天進行，但智慧型手機促使人們在夜晚也這麼做。」因此，除非攸關生死、茲事體大，否則還是把眼睛好好閉上。「臉書」不值得你一直瀏覽。&lt;/p&gt;

According to a report, one in three is so addicted to their phones that they check them constantly during the night. And if you’re in the 18-24 categories, this number goes up to one in two.It may seem harmless - but it’s incredibly damaging. Sleep experts have warned us over and over how looking at our phones at night can compromise our health. It’s all to do with the blue light our phone’s screen gives off.This light tells our body it’s daytime, which means when we do eventually fall back to sleep, that quality of sleep is not as good as it should be. The research said："What smartphones enable people to do is to keep tags of what’s happening, what people are saying, what people are posting. You can do that throughout the day and what smartphones are encouraging people to do is to do that at night."So unless it’s a matter of life or death, make sure you get some good shut eye. Facebook’s not worth so much of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
According to one report, one in three people is obsessed with mobile phones, and the night is always on the lookout. If you are a group of 18 to 24 years old, the proportion has even risen to 1 in 2 people. This may seem harmless, but in fact it is very lethal. Sleep experts have repeatedly warned that staring at the phone at night would hurt health. This has a lot to do with the blue light emitted by mobile phone screens. Blu-ray will make our body mistakenly believe that it is daytime; in other words, even if we fall asleep again, the quality of sleep will be greatly reduced. The study pointed out that "Smart phones allow people to track what is happening now, what people say, and what they upload. These things can happen during the day, but smart phones motivate people to do so at night. Therefore, unless you are dead or alive, you must keep your eyes closed. &lt;strong&gt;"Face Book" is not worth your while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Helen Newstead, head of language content at Collins said. ’Brexit’ has also been adapted to describe events coming to an end, such as ’Mexit’ for footballer Lionel Messi’s retirement and “Bradxit” for the end of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s marriage Other contenders for Collins’s word of the year included Trumpism. “Trump is not the first politician to have had his name co-opted by language：‘Thatcherism’ and ‘Reaganomics’, for example,” said Newstead. “However, the longevity of Trumpism as a word may depend on his success in the forthcoming election.”&lt;/p&gt;

（美國）猶他州歐格登的坎斯維爾小學每年西洋情人節當天都會舉行小六生舞會，藉此鼓勵學童融入與和睦，傳統上老師會告訴學生，被同學邀舞時要說好。但時代變了，而且在得知今年的舞會禮節後，部分學生家長火大了。當娜塔莉．李察從念小六的女兒處得知，不能在即將到來的舞會中拒絕男生的邀舞時，她為此震驚不已。值此家長教導孩子沒有必要擁抱朋友或甚至親吻其祖父母的時代，孩童掌握對自己身體的主控權已蔚為運動。對許多家長來說，無法拒絕舞伴有違此一原則。「此種女孩必須答應的作法，對女孩傳達一種不良訊息－－女孩不能說『不』，也對男孩傳達不良訊息。」李察說。&lt;/p&gt;

Kanesville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah, holds a sixth-grade dance on Valentine’s Day each year. The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.But times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance’s protocol this year.Natalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn’t refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.At a time when parents are teaching kids they don’t need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there’s been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.To many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.It "sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say ’yes’ － sends a bad message to boys that girls can’t say ’no,’" Richard said.&lt;/p&gt;

(USA) The Cansville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah Each year, a six-dollar ball will be held on Valentine's Day to encourage students to integrate into harmony. Traditionally, teachers will tell students that they should be good when invited by classmates. However, the times have changed, and after learning of this year's dance etiquette, some students’ parents have become very hot. &lt;strong&gt;When Natalie.&lt;/strong&gt; When Richard learned from the daughter of Nian Xiaoliu that she could not reject the boy's invitation dance at the upcoming dance party, she was shocked by this. Parents teach children that there is no need to embrace friends or even kiss their grandparents. Children have mastered the right to exercise control over their bodies. For many parents, the inability to refuse the partner violates this principle. "This kind of girl must agree to the practice, to convey a bad message to the girl - the girl can not say "no", but also to convey bad news to the boy." Richard said.&lt;/p&gt;

The emailed response from the Guggenheim’s chief curator to the White House was polite but firm：The museum could not accommodate a request to borrow a painting by Vincent van Gogh for President and Melania Trump’s private living quarters.Instead, wrote the curator, Nancy Spector, another piece was available, one that was nothing like "Landscape With Snow," the 1888 van Gogh rendering of a man in a black hat walking along a path in Arles, France, with his dog.The curator’s alternative： an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet — an interactive work titled "America" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed at the excess of wealth in this country.For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited "America" — the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan — in a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor for visitors to use.&lt;/p&gt;

至少8萬6000年前的一件人類手指骨骼顯示，阿拉伯半島是石器時代人類遷出非洲的重要地點，人類藉此迅速擴散至亞洲。這項微型證據產於沙烏地阿拉伯內夫得沙漠中一處遺址、位於中央區的出土文物。考古學家豪烏畢．格魯卡特和米赫依．派特利雅領導的團隊表示，根據該件骨骼的定年，它是迄今在非洲以外所發現最古老的智人化石，並指出這塊中東地區的狹長地帶，連結非洲與亞洲。科學家在4月9日刊登於《自然生態學與進化》期刊的報告中表示，這項新發現強化了以下觀點：早期人類遷出非洲的時間，早於傳統上估計的6萬年前，人類的擴散並曾深入阿拉伯半島。牛津大學的格魯卡特猜測，這件2016年在中央區的發現，可能是一名成人的中指中節指骨。但還不清楚這塊骨骼來自男性或女性，是右手或左手。&lt;/p&gt;

A single human finger bone from at least 86,000 years ago points to Arabia as a key destination for Stone Age excursions out of Africa that allowed people to rapidly spread across Asia.Excavations at Al Wusta, a site in Saudi Arabia’s Nefud desert, produced this diminutive discovery. It’s the oldest known Homo sapiens fossil outside of Africa and the narrow strip of the Middle East that joins Africa with Asia, based on dating of the bone itself, says a team led by archaeologists Huw Groucutt and Michael Petraglia. This new find strengthens the idea that early human dispersals out of Africa began well before the traditional estimated departure time of 60,000 years ago and extended deep into Arabia, the scientists report April 9 in Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution.The 2016 Al Wusta find is probably the middle bone from an adult’s middle finger, suspects Groucutt, of the University of Oxford. It’s unclear whether the bone came from a man or a woman, or from a right or left hand.\n新聞辭典&lt;/p&gt;

Archaeologist Howe. &lt;strong&gt;Grukat and Mihei.&lt;/strong&gt; The team led by Patria has stated that according to the dating of the skeleton, it is the oldest Homo sapiens found outside Africa so far, and points out that this narrow strip of Middle East connects Africa with Asia.

不少有趣的飲食趨勢橫掃亞洲。最新一個是日本使用數學方程式的飲食趨勢，在年輕女性間受到歡迎，稱為「灰姑娘體重」。灰姑娘體重（公斤）是藉由計算一個人身高（公尺）的二次方，然後再乘以18。例如，若一名女性身高1.8公尺，她的灰姑娘體重將是：1.8乘以1.8等於3.24；3.24再乘以18等於58.32。灰姑娘體重的目標是身體質量指數（BMI）18，這在BMI等級的正式分類中屬於「體重過輕」。營養師擔心，這種不切實際的灰姑娘飲食，不僅負面地將虛構的身體比例浪漫化，同時也鼓勵極端飲食。營養學家萊安諾．蘭伯特對臨床上的「體重過輕」發出危險警告。她指出：「過輕對妳的健康不利。體重太輕可能造成免疫系統虛弱、骨骼脆弱及感覺疲累。」&lt;/p&gt;

There have been a number of interesting diet trends sweeping throughout Asia. The latest one in Japan uses a mathematical formula that’s seeing increased popularity among young women called the ’Cinderella weight’.The Cinderella weight（in kilograms）is calculated by squaring a person’s height（in meters）, then multiplying that number by 18. For example, if a woman was 1.8m tall, her Cinderella weight would be：1.8×1.8=3.24 ; 3.24×18=58.32.The Cinderella weight aims for a body mass index of 18, which is officially classified as ’underweight’ on the BMI scale. Dieticians are worried the unrealistic Cinderella diet is not only negatively romanticizing fictionalized body proportions, but also encouraging extreme dieting.Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert warned of the dangers of being clinically ’underweight’. She said：’Being underweight isn’t good for your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired.’&lt;/p&gt;

Many interesting dietary trends sweep across Asia. The latest one is Japan's dietary trend using mathematical equations. It is popular among young women and is called "Cinderella Weight." Cinderella's weight (in kilograms) is calculated by calculating the quadratic height of a person's height (meter), and then multiplying by 18. For example, if a woman is 1.8 meters tall, her Cinderella weight will be: 1.8 times 1.8 equals 3.24; 3.24 and then 18 equals 58.32. The goal of Cinderella's weight is a body mass index (BMI) of 18, which is "underweight" in the official classification of BMI levels. Nutritionists worry that this impractical Cinderella diet not only negatively romanticizes the fictional body proportion but also encourages extreme diets. &lt;strong&gt;Nutritionist Leonardo.&lt;/strong&gt; Lambert issued a dangerous warning on clinical "underweight."

US taxpayers unnecessarily spent $28m on uniforms for the Afghan National Army, according to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. In a scathing report, John Sopko said that officials bought "forest" pattern uniforms, despite the country’s landscape being only 2.1% wooded. The decision was "not based on an evaluation of its appropriateness for the Afghan environment", he wrote. A former Afghan defence minister chose the pattern in 2007, he says.In the 17-page report, Sopko writes that Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak chose the privately owned pattern over a cheaper pattern that the US military already owned. US officials, who had been searching for patterns online with Wardak, authorised the purchase because he "liked what he saw"."My concern is what if the minister of defence liked purple, or liked pink?" Sopko told USA Today in an interview. "Are we going to buy pink uniforms for soldiers and not ask questions? That’s insane. We wasted $28 million of taxpayers’ money in the name of fashion, because the defence minister thought that that pattern was pretty."&lt;/p&gt;

俄羅斯滑雪射擊運動員在冬季兩項世界錦標賽中一場令人難堪的頒獎典禮上，因主辦單位播放舊版俄國國歌，而決定在沒有任何樂器伴奏下清唱自己的國歌。當用來表揚週六晚間4人7.5公里接力賽俄國隊勝利的，顯然是舊版俄國國歌後，典禮中斷。然而，阿列克謝．沃科夫、梅辛．茨維特科夫、安東．巴比科夫，以及安東．舒普林，不等正確版播放，便開始在無伴奏情況下高唱自己的國歌。發生這起事件的一週前，美國網球協會在夏威夷舉行的一場網球錦標賽上，因意外演唱納粹時期的德國國歌，而被迫出面致歉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Russian biathletes decided to sing their national anthem without any instrumental accompaniment after organizers played an outdated version in an embarrassing medal ceremony at the biathlon world championships.The ceremony was interrupted when it became clear that the old version of the anthem was being used to honor Russia’s victory in Saturday night’s 4x7.5-kilometer relay.However, Alexey Volkov, Maxim Tsvetkov, Anton Babikov and Anton Shipulin didn’t wait for the correct version to be played and started singing their national anthem unaccompanied.The incident came just one week after the United States Tennis Association had to apologize after a German national anthem used during the Nazi-era was accidentally played at a tennis tournament in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

Russian ski-shooting athletes decided to sing their national anthem without any instrumental accompaniment as the organizer played the old Russian national anthem at an embarrassing ceremony at the biathlon world championship. The ceremony was interrupted when it was apparent that it was the old Russian national anthem that was used to celebrate the victory of the Russian team in the 7.5-kilometer relay race on Saturday night. However, Alexei. &lt;strong&gt;Volkov, Messing&lt;/strong&gt;Tsvetkov, Anton&lt;strong&gt;Babikov, and Anton.&lt;/strong&gt;d Anton. Shu Pulin, without waiting for the correct version to play, began to sing his own national anthem without accompaniment. A week before this incident, the U.S. Tennis Association was forced to apologize in a tennis tournament in Hawaii for accidentally singing the Nazi German anthem.&lt;/p&gt;

根據「有線－衛星公共事務網絡」公佈的總統歷史學家調查，亞伯拉罕．林肯、喬治．華盛頓、狄奧多（泰迪）．羅斯福和富蘭克林．羅斯福，仍被視為美國歷史上最偉大的4位總統。德懷特．艾森豪則是首次進入前5名。 這份調查要求91名總統歷史學家評價美國總統，依據10種總統領導才能進行1到10分的評比，包括公眾說服力、危機管理、經濟管理、道德權威、國際關係等。林肯仍是美國有史以來最棒的總統。 評價最糟糕的總統包括安德魯．詹森和富蘭克林．皮爾斯。在美國迎向內戰之際領導國家的詹姆斯．布坎南則墊底。同樣值得注意的是，喬治．布希突然提高3個名次至33名。 巴拉克．歐巴馬則在43名前最高統帥中排名第12名，位於伍德羅．威爾遜（11名）和詹姆斯．門羅（13名）之間。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt are still considered the four best presidents in American history, according to a survey of presidential historians released by C-SPAN. Dwight Eisenhower moved into the top five for the first time. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rate the presidents on a scale of 1 to 10 on 10 qualities of presidential leadership, including public persuasion, crisis management, economic management, moral authority, international relations, etc. Lincoln remains America’s best president of all time. The worst ranked presidents include Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. James Buchanan, who led the country as it headed into Civil War, came in last. Also notable：George W. Bush bumped up three spots to 33rd. Barack Obama ranked 12th on the list of 43 former commanders in chief, placing between Woodrow Wilson （No. 11） and James Monroe （No. 12）.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
According to a survey of presidential historians published by the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network, Abraham. Lincoln, George. Washington, Theodor (Teddy). Roosevelt and Franklin. Roosevelt is still regarded as the greatest four presidents in U.S. history. Dwight. Eisenhower is entering the top 5 for the first time. The survey required 91 presidential historians to evaluate the U.S. president and to make a 1-10 rating based on 10 presidential leadership skills, including public persuasion, crisis management, economic management, moral authority, and international relations. Lincoln is still the best president in the United States ever. The worst-rated president includes Andrew. &lt;strong&gt;Jensen and Franklin.&lt;/strong&gt; Pierce. James, who led the country when the United States reached the civil w&lt;strong&gt;Buchanan is at the bottom.&lt;/strong&gt;tom. It is also worth noting that George. Bush suddenly raised 3 places to 33. Barak. Obama was ranked 12th out of 43 former supreme commanders in Woodrow. Wilson (11) and&lt;strong&gt;Monroe (13).&lt;/strong&gt;oe (13).&lt;/p&gt;

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.


紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。


纽约州布法罗市的一家博物馆最近发现，其珍藏的罕见大象鸟蛋已被错误标记为数十年的模型。布法罗科学博物馆的藏品管理人员在将其目录更新为数字系统时发现了“现实“它收集了1000多个鸡蛋中的奶油色鸡蛋。部分化石化的鸡蛋周围28英寸，体重超过3磅。策展人将鸡蛋带到纽约州立大学布法罗艺术保护系进行射线照相 - 这是一种利用X射线观察物体内部的技术。该测试不仅证实了他们的怀疑，而且还显示了“白色的规格”，表明它可能已经受精。博物馆记录显示，之前的馆长在1939年从伦敦标本制作者那里获得了大象鸟蛋，售价为92美元。这位动物标本在马达加斯加岛购买了鸡蛋 - 位于印度洋非洲东南海岸 - 鸟类的原生栖息地。这只不能飞翔的鸟儿长到10英尺高，体重在770到1,100磅之间，并且规模最大任何脊椎动物的蛋 - 甚至是恐龙。它在600多年前灭绝了。

Local governments are promoting "peace-themed" tours along their border with North Korea amid the continuing peace overtures between the two Koreas.Gangwon Province, which borders the eastern half of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), hopes the continuing peace overtures and international spotlight on the Korea Peninsula since the April 27 summit will attract foreign tourists and revive the local economy.Earlier this month, Gangwon Province and the KTO hosted a series of DMZ tours for 200 foreign travel agents, people with social media influence, and exchange students. Travel agencies that already provide similar tours say business has boomed since the inter-Korean summit.


在兩韓之間持續求和下，（南韓）地方政府正沿著北韓邊界一帶推動「和平主題」觀光。和南、北韓非軍事區東半部接壤的南韓江原道，就希望自4月27日兩韓峰會以來，兩韓持續求和以及國際間對朝鮮半島的聚焦，會吸引外國觀光客、振興當地經濟。本（5）月稍早，江原道及「韓國觀光公社」為200家旅行社、在社群媒體上擁有影響力的人士和外國交換學生，主辦一系列的兩韓非軍事區遊覽。已提供類似旅遊行程的旅行社說，自兩韓峰會以來，生意蒸蒸日上。

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops. The horse is showing you a mind that doesn’t stop, that is tormented," he says.（Reuters）


在馬德里外圍的瓜達利斯山裡，阿根廷馴馬師費爾南多．諾瓦耶斯出動他的動物，來幫助蒙受壓力與焦慮的民眾。這位曾在巴塔哥尼亞原野與馬兒生活多年的57歲男子，用這些動物做為病人解讀與控制自身情緒的一種方法。每堂課收費高達120歐元的諾瓦耶斯說，來到他課堂的民眾和馬兒共度時光，並透過馬兒的動作，來認識自身當下的心理狀態。他說，「馬是面鏡子。」「牠們是群居動物，天生活在馬群裡。」這種療法在於監測馬兒如何呼應客戶心情。他說，從觀察馬的反應，客戶學會如何辨識和控制情緒。他說：「處於困難心理狀態之中時，民眾上第一堂課，看著一匹動不停、甚至狂奔的馬兒。這匹馬對你顯示了一顆受到折磨的不停歇的心。」（路透）


在马德里郊外的瓜达利克斯山脉，阿根廷马语耳语费尔南多·诺埃尔用他的动物来帮助患有压力和焦虑的人们。这位57岁的人，在巴塔哥尼亚的荒野生活着许多年，他们用马为动物患者来解释和控制他们的情绪。来到他的会议的人们花时间陪伴马，并通过动物的运动了解他们自己的精神状态，Noailles说，每场会议收费高达120欧元。“马是一面镜子，“他说。 “他们是合群的生物，生来就活在牛群中。”治疗包括监测马如何回应客户的情绪。 “从观察马的反应，客户学会如何识别和控制情绪，”他说，“第一次会议的人，当他们处于困难的状态时，看到一匹马不停止，移动，甚至这匹马向你展示了一种不停止的思想，这是一种折磨，“他说，”（路透社）

Kanesville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah, holds a sixth-grade dance on Valentine’s Day each year. The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.But times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance’s protocol this year.Natalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn’t refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.At a time when parents are teaching kids they don’t need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there’s been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.To many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.It "sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say ’yes’ － sends a bad message to boys that girls can’t say ’no,’" Richard said.


（美國）猶他州歐格登的坎斯維爾小學每年西洋情人節當天都會舉行小六生舞會，藉此鼓勵學童融入與和睦，傳統上老師會告訴學生，被同學邀舞時要說好。但時代變了，而且在得知今年的舞會禮節後，部分學生家長火大了。當娜塔莉．李察從念小六的女兒處得知，不能在即將到來的舞會中拒絕男生的邀舞時，她為此震驚不已。值此家長教導孩子沒有必要擁抱朋友或甚至親吻其祖父母的時代，孩童掌握對自己身體的主控權已蔚為運動。對許多家長來說，無法拒絕舞伴有違此一原則。「此種女孩必須答應的作法，對女孩傳達一種不良訊息－－女孩不能說『不』，也對男孩傳達不良訊息。」李察說。


犹他州奥格登的Kanesville小学每年在情人节举办六年级舞蹈。舞蹈的目的是为了促进包容和友善，学生传统上被老师告知在同学要求他们跳舞时说“是”。但时代已经改变，并且有些父母今年因舞蹈协议风而感到愤怒娜塔莉·理查德对她的六年级女儿告诉她，在即将到来的舞蹈中不能拒绝与一个男孩跳舞，她感到震惊。当父母教孩子时，他们不需要拥抱朋友，甚至不必亲吻他们的祖父母，一直在向保持对自己身体的控制的孩子们发起一场运动。对许多父母来说，无法拒绝舞伴是违背这一规定的。它“向女孩发出一个坏消息，女孩必须说&amp;amp;#39;是&amp;amp;#39; - 发送一个坏消息给男孩，女孩不能说&amp;amp;#39;不&amp;amp;#39;，“理查德说。

Massoumeh Attaie does not want to be defined only by the evil that drove her father-in-law to blind her with acid in her face. She wants to be known as an artist.Eight years ago, the 35-year-old Iranian was left permanently disfigured, only because she had sought a divorce.She never got justice under Iran’s Islamic law. And in the end, the family threatened that the same punishment would befall her son if she pressed charges."I chose my son over justice," she said － a terrible choice she says she has put behind her and refuses to let crush her spirit.Recently, she joined a group of other victims of acid attacks presenting their work at a gallery in Tehran to raise awareness and money. Attaie makes pottery, sculpted bowls and statuettes.She now lives in Tehran with her 12-year-old son, having fled her family, gives art classes to other blind people and proudly says she is "totally independent".


瑪索梅．阿堤被公公朝臉上潑酸而失明，但她不想只因為曾遭到邪惡對待，而被人們記住。她想成為一名藝術家。8年前，這名35歲的伊朗婦女永久性毀容，只因為她提出離婚。由於伊朗厲行伊斯蘭教律法，她從未獲得平反。最後，夫家還威脅，若她提出告訴，她的兒子將遭到相同懲罰。她說：「我選擇了兒子，而非正義。」但她也說，她已放下這個令人痛心疾首的決定，拒絕因為這個決定而精神崩潰。最近，她參加一個由其他潑酸受害者組成的團體，一起在德黑蘭一家藝廊展出作品，以提升社會關注及募款。阿堤創作陶器，雕刻碗盆和雕塑品。逃家後，她現在與12歲的兒子住在德黑蘭，為其他失明者上藝術課。她自豪地說，自己已「完全獨立」。


Massoumeh Attaie不想仅仅被那些驱使她的岳父在她脸上用酸使她失明的罪恶所定义。她想成为一名艺术家。几年前，这位35岁的伊朗人被永久毁容，仅仅因为她寻求离婚。她从未在伊朗伊斯兰教法下获得正义。最后，家人威胁说，如果她提出指控，她的儿子也会受到同样的惩罚：“我选择了我的儿子过分公平，”她说 - 她说她放弃了她，并拒绝让她的精神压倒她的可怕选择。最近，她加入了一群其他酸性袭击受害者，他们在德黑兰的一家画廊展示他们的作品，以提高意识和金钱。 Attaie制作陶器，雕刻的碗和小雕像。她现在和她12岁的儿子一起生活在德黑兰，逃离家庭，为其他盲人提供艺术课，并自豪地说她是“完全独立的”。

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers. 


查克．麥卡錫的散步服務以每小時30美元的價格，提供新鮮空氣、運動與同伴情誼—不過在樹旁撒尿可絕對不行。這位洛杉磯企業家作為該市第一個遛人公司的創辦人，是與人類配合工作，而非動物，並捍衛健康與社會包容。「我考慮成為一名遛狗師。但我未曾在這座城市養過狗。」麥卡錫說。「我也看到許多私人教練的廣告。因此我對女友說『或許我就成為遛人師』。」麥卡錫在說笑，但當他越加思考，就越了解有對他能提供的那種同伴之誼的需求。「遛人師」2年前以1人運作方式開始營運。但需求之高，致使麥卡錫現在值勤表上有35名陪走者，人們可在網站上選擇路線與步行夥伴。不是因為人們的朋友變少，專家說，而是「零工經濟」已產生一個自由工作者世代，相關工作沒有傳統上聯繫工作者的例行公事或社會連結。


查克麦卡锡的步行服务提供新鲜空气，每小时30美元的运动和陪伴，但在树上撒尿绝对是不行的。这家位于洛杉矶的企业家与人类合作，而不是动物，并且作为该城市首个走人行业的创始人，对健康和社会融合构成打击。 “我正在考虑成为一名狗步行者，但我从来没有在这座城市养过一只狗，”麦卡锡说。 “我还看到很多私人教练的广告，所以我对我女朋友说：&amp;amp;#39;也许我只是成为一个人走路的人。&amp;amp;#39;”麦卡锡在开玩笑，但他越想越想到，他意识到的越多需要他可以提供的那种同志关系。人民步行者在两年前开始作为一个人的行动。但需求如此之高以至于麦卡锡现在拥有35名步行者名单，并有一个人们可以选择路线和步行伙伴的网站。专家说，并不是说人们有更少的朋友，而是说“经济转型”已经产生了一代自由职业者，没有传统上将工人联系起来的日常工作或社会纽带。

A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.


西班牙文「國家報」報導，一名受到神職人員性侵犯的智利男子表示，教宗方濟各告訴他，天主造他為同志，也愛如此的他。性侵受害者胡安‧卡洛斯‧克魯茲告訴「國家報」，教宗在私下對話時告訴他：「你是同性戀並不重要。天主如此造你，也愛如此的你，我不會在乎。教宗愛如此的你，你必須對自己感到快樂。」


根据西班牙报纸“El Pais”的报道，一名遭受神职人员性虐待的智利男子说教皇弗朗西斯告诉他上帝让他变成同性恋并且爱他。滥用毒品的受害者胡安卡洛斯克鲁斯告诉El Pais，教皇弗朗西斯曾在一位私人谈话：“你是同性恋并不重要，上帝以这种方式创造了你，并且以这种方式爱你，这对我来说并不重要，教皇这样爱你，你必须以你的方式开心。性虐待的幸存者克鲁兹在四月份与梵蒂冈教皇弗朗西斯共度了三天时间，在那里他讨论了他的性行为和他在智利神父手下遭受的虐待。这名男子在2011年被梵蒂冈发现有罪。

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.


地球的大氣中，無時無刻都含有約13兆公升的水蒸氣，相當於地表上所有淡水資源的10%。一款新開發的吸附劑近來顯示，即便相對濕度降至約10%，它也能從大氣中收穫水汽。在這種條件下，每100萬公升的空氣可產出約3公升的水。這款概念驗證裝置由美國麻省理工學院、加州大學柏克萊分校的協同團隊研發，使用柏克萊化學系教授奧馬．亞吉在1990年代發明的一種「金屬有機骨架（MOF）」材料。化學家利用金屬和有機分子，控制能與「金屬有機骨架」結合的氣體種類及其鍵結強度。該裝置本身可簡單分為兩個主要部分：吸收層（又稱MOF）和作為空氣冷凝器的封套。MOF的背面會塗成黑色，用來吸收太陽能。


地球大气在任何时候都包含大约13万亿升水蒸气 - 这相当于地球上所有可用地表淡水的10％。新开发的吸附剂最近表明，即使相对湿度下降到10％左右，它也可以收获大气中的水分。在这些条件下，每增加一百万升空气就能生产三升水。由麻省理工学院和加州大学伯克利分校的一个合作团队创建，这个概念证明设备使用了金属有机框架（MOFs），这是由伯克利加州化学教授Omar Yaghi在20世纪90年代发明的一种材料。根据所使用的金属和有机分子，化学家可以控制哪些气体将与MOF结合，以及这些连接会有多强。该设备本身是一个简单的设计，其主要部分有两个：吸收层（又名MOF）和封闭，一个风冷式冷凝器。 MOF的背面涂成黑色，用作太阳能吸收器。

Yu Jun-hyung, associate research fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, released the analysis as Seoul and Washington are in talks over the former’s share of the cost for maintaining some 28,500 US troops here.He put Seoul’s expenditure for the USFK in 2015 at some 5.4 trillion won （$5 billion）, with Japan’s spending around 6.77 trillion won. But Seoul shouldered a greater cost given that the American troop number in Japan was more than double that in the South in 2015."Given the total number of troops, South Korea pays more in all spending categories than Japan to support the US forces," he said during a forum organized by Rep. Kim Kyung-hyup of the ruling Democratic Party. Seoul has provided financial and other support under the Special Measures Agreement since 1991.


值此首爾和華府磋商前者在維持約2.85萬駐韓美軍開銷上的分攤比例之際，南韓國營「韓國國防研究院」副研究員柳俊亨發表相關分析。他估計，首爾2015年為駐韓美軍支出的經費約5.4兆韓元（50億美元），日本則支付近6.77兆韓元。但鑑於2015年駐日美軍的人數乃駐韓美軍的兩倍以上，故首爾負擔的費用更多。柳俊亨在南韓執政黨「共同民主黨」國會議員金炅俠舉辦的論壇中表示，「由於兵員的總數，為了資助美國駐軍，南韓在各類開支上付得都比日本多」。自1991年起，首爾即根據「特別措施協定」提供（美軍）財務及其他支持。


国营韩国国防分析研究所的副研究员余俊雄发布了这项分析报告，因为汉城和华盛顿正在就前者在这里维持大约28,500名美军的成本进行谈判。他将首尔的支出用于2015年的USFK约为5.4万亿韩元（约合50亿美元），日本的支出约为6.77万亿韩元。但考虑到2015年日本的美国军队数量比南方的美国军队数量多一倍，首尔承担了更大的成本。“考虑到部队总数，韩国在所有支出类别中支付的费用都超过日本，以支持美国军队，”他在执政的民主党代表Kim Kyung-hyup组织的一个论坛上说。自1991年以来，首尔根据特别措施协议提供了财政和其他支持。

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）


法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）


法国总统埃马纽埃尔马克隆上周在华盛顿的国事访问期间庆祝了美国和法国之间的特殊关系，他在白宫的土地上与唐纳德特朗普总统一棵树种植了一棵树。现在橡树苗木已经消失了 - 至少是暂时的。白色众议院摄影师注意到，树已经种植了几天后。随之而来的是神秘。事实上，来自法国Belleau Wood的这棵树，在第一次世界大战中死亡的近2,000名美国士兵在种植后不久被挖出。据美国和法国官员说，它被隔离了。问题是：树上的寄生虫可能会传播到白宫的其他地方，“Macron办公室的一位官员说，”这实际上是特朗普到法国的一个特殊情况，因为在总统访问当天能够种植这棵树。 （路透社）

Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）


和他以迴避搭機聞名的獨裁者父親不同，北韓領導人金正恩搭機前往中國東北部城市大連，成為32年來首位搭機出訪的北韓統治者。自2011年底執政以來，金正恩偶爾會在北韓國內搭乘飛機。最近這趟（訪中）海外行程，儘管（地點）距離北韓邊界不遠，時間點落在他與美國總統唐納．川普會面、以解決北韓核武問題為主旨的高峰會之前。金正恩曾在瑞士求學多年，據信在青少年時期經常搭機。成為北韓領導人後，（北韓）國營媒體說，金正恩曾搭乘「蒼鷹1號」校閱參與空中戰鬥競賽的空軍機隊，與視察平壤的建設工程。北韓媒體發佈的照片也顯示，金正恩坐在專機內朝窗外看、步下專機階梯，以及與妻子李雪主聯袂踏上機場跑道的紅地毯。（美聯社）


不像他独裁父亲那样着名避开航空旅行，朝鲜领导人金正恩（Jet Jong）在中国东北部城市大连涌入，成为第一位在32年内飞往国外的朝鲜统治者。自从2011年底上任以来，金曾偶尔在朝鲜境内飞行。最近的这次外国之行，尽管离朝鲜边境不远，但是在他与美国总统唐纳德特朗普举行首脑会议之前，旨在结束朝鲜的核问题。在瑞士冷静了好几年，金被认为经常乘飞机旅行，一名青少年。在他成为朝鲜领导人后，官方媒体称他在回顾参加空战飞机参加战斗航空比赛并检查平壤建筑工作时正在参加Chammae-1。朝鲜媒体的照片也显示金正望着他的飞机的窗户;从飞机上走下楼梯，然后和他的妻子Ri Sol Ju一起走在放在简易机场上的红地毯上。 （AP）

Workers spending their lunch break at the gym may be commonplace in most Western countries, but in Sweden some employers are pushing the idea even further, making on-the-job exercise compulsory.Every Friday, employees of fashion and sportswear retailer Bjorn Borg leave their desks at the company’s Stockholm headquarters to get their weekly workout at a nearby gym.There is no getting out of it：for more than two years the company founded by the Swedish tennis legend has made on-the-job exercise mandatory at the initiative of chief executive Henrik Bunge, a 44-year-old built like a wrestler."If you don’t want to exercise or be a part of the company culture, you have to go," says Bunge, without batting an eye. So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.


在多數西方國家，勞工在健身房度過午休時間，似乎司空見慣，但在瑞典，有些雇主延伸思考，讓運動成為工作上的義務。每週五，瑞典運動服飾零售商「比約恩．柏格」的員工，都會離開斯德哥爾摩公司總部的辦公室，到附近一間健身房進行每週運動。沒有人可以例外，因為這間由瑞典網球傳奇人物比約恩．柏格創立的公司，2年多來貫徹體態宛如摔角選手的44歲執行長漢瑞克．邦吉的倡議，強制要求員工在工作時間運動。「如果你不想運動，或不願融入企業文化，你就必須離開。」邦吉眼睛眨也不眨地說。他還提到，迄今沒有任何人因為這項要求而辭職。這項政策的主要目標，是希望在提高生產力和利潤之外，也能增進同事間的情誼。


在大多数西方国家，工作人员在健身房度过午餐时间可能是司空见惯的，但在瑞典，一些雇主正在进一步推动这一想法，使得在职锻炼成为强制性的。每周五，时尚和运动服饰零售商比约恩博格的员工离开他们在公司的斯德哥尔摩总部工作，每周在附近的健身房锻炼身体。没有脱身：由瑞典网球传奇公司创办的公司已经有两年多的时间在职首席执行官亨里克·邦格（Henrik Bunge），44岁，如同一名摔跤手一样，“如果你不想锻炼或成为公司文化的一部分，你就必须走了，”邦格说，没有打击眼睛。到目前为止，还没有人因需求而退出，他补充道。该政策的主要目标是提高生产力和盈利能力，同时培养劳动力中的友谊。

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.


日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。


一列日本铁路公司已经为火车离开火车站25秒后离开火车站造成的任何不便表示歉意，这是几个月后的第二起火车票。火车定于上午7点22分离开日本滋贺省的Notogawa车站。列车售票员认为火车本打算在早上7点11分离开，所以他早早关上了车门。他意识到自己的错误，但因为他看不到任何人在平台上并决定起飞。提前离开并没有影响当天的其他旅行时间表，但仍有人希望上车。他们向铁路运营商JR West投诉，并在事后不久发布了正式道歉。日本火车以极端的守时而闻名。去年秋天发生类似事件之后，东京至东部城市筑波的火车早20秒离开，促使筑波特快公司的经营者公开道歉。

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again. 


根據週二（5月1日）發表的一項研究，木蛙整個冬季會一直憋尿，透過回收尿素維生。（美國）阿拉斯加州的木蛙能夠8個月不排尿，現在科學家已經弄清楚牠們是怎麼辦到的；更準確地講，是牠們如何透過不排尿來維持生命。這項刊登在《皇家學會報告生物科學版》期刊的研究報告指出，這種青蛙的腸道擁有能夠回收尿素的特殊微生物，而尿素是尿液中的主要廢棄物。藉由回收尿素成為有用的氮，這種小青蛙能在冬眠及受凍時維持生命。儘管回收尿素無法暖和身體，但它能保護細胞和組織，即便當時牠們的心臟、腦和血流停止運作。阿拉斯加木蛙的體溫可降至零度低溫。一旦接近春天、溫度回升，這種青蛙就會恢復生機；牠們解凍後再次開始進食和交配。


根据周二（5月1日）公布的一项研究，木青蛙在整个冬季都将尿液作为回收尿素的生存机制。在阿拉斯加，木蛙历经八个月不排尿，现在科学家已经弄清楚他们是如何做到的 - 更准确地说，他们如何在不做它的情况下生存下来。青蛙内胆中的特殊微生物回收尿素，这是尿液中的主要废物，在英国皇家学会会刊B的报告中报道。反过来，将尿素回收利用成为有用的氮气，小青蛙活着，因为他们冬眠和冻结，里面和外面。尽管它不会使它们变暖，但尿素仍能保护细胞和组织，即使这些小动物的心脏，大脑和血流也停止了。阿拉斯加的青蛙冷得像零度。但一旦温度接近春天，青蛙就会恢复生机;他们解冻并开始喂食和再次交配。

Rival parties’ wrangling over the local elections and North Korean denuclearization continued Sunday. " (Liberty Korea Party) Chairman Hong Joon-pyo is misleading the public as if the Moon Jae-in administration pleaded with the US to hold the US-North Korea summit on June 12, a day before the local elections," said Rep. Back Hye-ryun of the Democratic Party. "According to Chairman Hong’s words, the US government is interfering with our elections, it is a very dangerous statement.""In the end, the administration is trying to bury the June 13 local elections with the South-North peace show." Hong claimed. Hong and his hard-line conservative party accused Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un of putting up "a show of false peace."


南韓敵對政黨針對該國地方選舉和北韓無核化的爭吵，週日仍未平息。「共同民主黨」國會議員白惠蓮說，「『自由韓國黨』黨魁洪準杓正誤導社會大眾，彷彿是文在寅政府乞求美國於6月12日舉行美國—北韓峰會，也就是南韓地方選舉前一天」。「據他所述，美國政府正在干預我國選舉，這可是非常危險的說法。」洪準杓聲稱，「到頭來，文在寅政府正企圖利用兩韓和平秀，掩蓋6月13日舉行的地方選舉」。洪及其領導的強硬派保守政黨指控文與北韓領導人金正恩聯手建構「一場虛偽的和平秀」。


周日，竞争党对地方选举和朝鲜无核化问题的争论继续进行。 “（自由韩国党）洪俊杓董事长误导公众，好像月亮政府恳求美国在地方选举前一天的6月12日举行美朝会议。”返回民主党的惠云。 “按照洪主席的话说，美国政府正在干涉我们的选举，这是一个非常危险的说法。”“最后，政府试图将6月13日的地方选举埋葬在南北和平展览中。”洪声称。洪秀全和他的强硬派保守党指责文在仁和朝鲜领导人金正恩提出“虚假和平表现”。

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.


袋鼠是澳洲觀光引人入勝的要角之一，但一家公園的遊客所獲超乎了他們所求。距離雪梨有兩小時火車路程的麥覺理湖市觀光客忽略警示，餵袋鼠吃紅蘿蔔，牠們一看到最愛之含糖零食就變得具有攻擊性。受到保證「可愛野生袋鼠」是「溫馴到可以靠近及一起拍照」的眾多旅遊部落格誘惑，每週有數千人蜂擁來看一家精神病院附近草坡上的袋鼠。手裡拿紅蘿蔔，遊客接近袋鼠，想和澳洲象徵來個自拍。但結局並非一向美好。一張貼到臉書的照片顯示，一隻袋鼠跳起來，用牠有力的腿踢了一名遊客。其他照片顯示，一名婦女臉遭抓傷，一名男子流血破肚。經營到這處公園觀光巴士服務的謝恩．路易斯告訴路透，「不論在什麼情境下，袋鼠可能偶爾具有侵略性，但九成是試著餵牠們的民眾被攻擊。」


袋鼠是澳大利亚最大的旅游景点之一，但来到一个公园的游客获得的价格超过了他们的预算。来自悉尼的两个小时火车车程的麦觉理湖的旅游者忽视了警告并将胡萝卜送给袋鼠，因为它们在视线上变得咄咄逼人每周有数千人涌入精神病医院附近的草坡上看袋鼠，并被旅游博客引诱，他们承诺“可爱的野生袋鼠”能够“驯服到接近并拍照”。胡萝卜在手中，游客接近袋鼠，寻求一种带有澳大利亚象征的自拍照。它并不总是很好。Facebook上发布的一张照片显示，一只袋鼠以强有力的腿跳跃起来游客。其他照片显示，一名女子脸部有刮痕，一名男子肚子里有血迹。“无论情况如何，袋鼠偶尔会有攻击性，但90％的时间是试图喂养他们的人袭击“，负责公园旅游接送服务的Shane Lewis告诉路透社。

The emailed response from the Guggenheim’s chief curator to the White House was polite but firm：The museum could not accommodate a request to borrow a painting by Vincent van Gogh for President and Melania Trump’s private living quarters.Instead, wrote the curator, Nancy Spector, another piece was available, one that was nothing like "Landscape With Snow," the 1888 van Gogh rendering of a man in a black hat walking along a path in Arles, France, with his dog.The curator’s alternative： an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet — an interactive work titled "America" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed at the excess of wealth in this country.For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited "America" — the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan — in a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor for visitors to use.


古根漢博物館總館長回覆白宮的電子郵件很有禮貌，但立場也很堅定：該館無法應允出借一幅梵谷的畫作，讓川普總統與第一夫人梅蘭妮亞掛在私人起居區的要求。取而代之的是，館長南西．史貝克特寫道，另一件藝術創作倒是可以出借，但該作品與描繪一名戴黑帽的男子，沿著法國阿爾勒的小徑遛狗的1888年梵谷畫作「雪景」，毫無相似之處。館長的替代方案是：1個18K、功能完備的黃金馬桶—一件名為「美國」、被批評者形容為尖銳諷刺美國財富過剩的互動式作品。


古根海姆首席策展人给白宫的电子邮件回应很有礼貌但坚定：博物馆无法容纳Vincent van Gogh为总统和Melania Trump的私人住所借用一幅画的请求。相反，该馆馆长Nancy Spector写道，另一件作品可以提供，其中一件与“雪景”无关，1888年梵高渲染一名戴着黑帽子的男子正在法国阿尔勒的一条小路上与他的狗一起走。策展人的另一种选择是：18克拉，功能齐全的纯金洗手间 - 这是一部名为“美国”的互动作品，评论家称这些作品是针对这个国家财富过剩的尖锐讽刺。一年来，古根海姆展出了“美国” - 创作当代艺术家莫里吉奥卡特兰 - 在博物馆五楼的公共休息室供游人使用。

Syrian student Nour wistfully examines her bare ring finger, then scans fellow classmates around her at Damascus University. Amid the sea of women, there’s no eligible single man in sight.At 30, Nour says she is eager to get married － but Syria’s protracted conflict means potential suitors have emigrated, joined the army or lost their lives.Syria’s conflict erupted in 2011 with mass protests, just as Nour was preparing to graduate with her first degree in economics. Later Nour has opted to pursue her second degree at Damascus University in literature."I’ve got nothing to fill my time with. No friend, no lover, no husband," Nour sighs, pulling her dyed blonde hair away. "I’m terrified I’ll find a grey hair before I get married."In Syria’s conservative society, women were generally expected to marry in their 20s, but the lack of eligible bachelors has somewhat relaxed those norms."Now, a woman could marry at 32 without people saying she’s late to wed," said Salam Qassem, a psychology professor in Damascus.


敘利亞學生諾爾若有所思地看著自己空無一物的無名指，接著掃視大馬士革大學裡的同班同學。在女人堆中，遍尋不著一名合適的單身男子。30歲的諾爾說自己很渴望婚姻，但敘利亞漫長的內戰，讓潛在的追求者不是移民、從軍，就是已一命嗚呼。敘利亞在2011年爆發大規模示威後陷入內戰，當時諾爾即將取得第一個經濟學學位。之後，諾爾選擇在大馬士革大學攻讀第二個文學學位。「我不知道如何打發時間。沒有朋友、沒有情人、也沒有丈夫。」諾爾一邊感嘆，一邊撥開染成金黃色的秀髮。「我很害怕在我出嫁前，頭上就出現華髮。」在保守的敘利亞社會，女性通常被期待20幾歲就結婚，但由於欠缺合適的單身漢，這些規範已有所鬆動。大馬士革心理學教授薩朗．卡瑟姆說：「女性現在就算在32歲結婚，也沒人會說她晚嫁了。」


叙利亚学生努尔渴望检查她的无名指，然后在大马士革大学扫描身边的同学。在女性的海洋中，没有合适的单身男子在望。30日，努尔表示她渴望结婚 - 但叙利亚的长期冲突意味着潜在的求婚者已经移民，加入军队或失去生命。2011年的叙利亚冲突爆发大众抗议，就像努尔正准备毕业并获得经济学学士学位。后来，努尔选择在大马士革大学攻读文学学士学位，“我没有什么可以填补我的空间的，没有朋友，没有情人，没有丈夫，”努尔叹了一口气，把她染成金色的头发拉开。 “我害怕在结婚之前会发现一头灰白的头发。”在叙利亚保守的社会中，女性通常会在20多岁时结婚，但缺乏符合条件的单身汉已经略微放松了这些标准。“现在，一位女士可以在32岁就结婚，没有人说她晚婚了，“大马士革心理学教授萨拉姆卡西姆说。

A Japanese author of children’s books, Eiko Kadono, has won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, considered the Nobel Prize for children’s literature. The Swiss-based International Board on Books for Young People made the announcement on Monday.Kadono is best known as the author of "Kiki’s Delivery Service". The novel, about a young witch, was adapted into an animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki called "Majo no Takkyubin".Kadono has published nearly 200 books, including a series about 3 little monsters. The board called her a great Japanese author and said her work possesses an ineffable charm, compassion, and flair. It also said that her stories are deeply rooted in her native land and show children a Japan that is filled with all kinds of unexpected people.Kadono is the 3rd Japanese to win the award. It went to Michio Mado in 1994 and Nahoko Uehashi in 2014.


日本童書作者角野榮子贏得「安徒生獎」，該獎被視為兒童文學的諾貝爾獎。總部設於瑞士的國際兒童圖書評議會，週一公佈這項訊息。角野最為人所知的身分，是「魔女宅急便」的作者。這部有關一名年輕女巫的小說，被改編成宮崎駿執導的動畫影片「魔女宅急便」。角野發表了近200本書，包括有關3個小怪獸的系列作品。該評議會稱她是偉大的日本作家，並說她的作品具有難以言喻的魅力、憐憫與文采。評議會還說，她的故事深刻扎根於她的原鄉，並向兒童展現一個充滿各種意外人物的日本。角野是第3位贏得該獎項的日本人。1994年這座大獎獎落窗道雄，2014年則是上橋菜穗子。


日本的儿童书籍作家英子嘉多诺赢得了安徒生奖，被认为是诺贝尔儿童文学奖。总部位于瑞士的国际青年书籍委员会周一宣布。卡多诺以“Kiki的送货服务”的作者而闻名。这部小说关于一个年轻的女巫，被改编成由宫崎骏导演的动画电影“魔女的高阶像”.Kadono出版了近200本书，其中包括一系列约3个小怪物。董事会称她是一位伟大的日本作家，并称她的作品具有不可思议的魅力，同情心和才华。它还说，她的故事深深地扎根于她的祖国，并向孩子们展示了一个充满各种意想不到的人的日本。卡多诺是第三位获此殊荣的日本人。它于1994年参加了Michio Mado和2014年的Nahoko Uehashi。

New research reveals eating bananas every day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. High in potassium, foods like bananas can stop fatal blockages from occurring and inhibit the hardening and narrowing of arteries. Researchers at the University of Alabama analyzed mice who were at risk of heart disease. The mice were fed either low, normal or high levels of potassium with the results showing that the arteries of mice fed a low-potassium diet became significantly harder. In contrast, the mice given high potassium had less artery hardening.The vital mineral － which spuds, broccoli and sprouts are also rich in － was found to aid blood flow to the heart and brain and reduce the risk of clots. Other foods rich in the mineral include parsnips, seeds, fish and poultry.However, eating too much potassium can cause stomach ache, nausea and diarrhea. Older people may be more at risk because their kidneys may be less able to remove potassium from the blood.


新研究揭露，每天吃香蕉可能有助於預防心臟病及中風。香蕉等富含鉀的食物，可防止致命心血管堵塞發生，並抑制動脈硬化及狹窄。阿拉巴馬大學研究人員分析具心臟病風險的老鼠。這些老鼠被餵食低、中或高水平的鉀，結果顯示給予低鉀飲食的老鼠動脈顯著硬化。對照之下，餵食高鉀的老鼠較少動脈硬化。 這種重要的礦物質—土豆、花椰菜及豆芽也富含—被發現有助於血液流入心臟及大腦，並可降低血栓風險。其他富含這種礦物質的食物，還包括防風草、種子、魚類及家禽等。然而，食用過多的鉀可能導致胃痛、噁心及腹瀉。老年人的危險性可能更高，因為他們的腎臟可能比較無法排除血液中的鉀。

On May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry. The couple will wed in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — a royal residence in the small town of Windsor some 22 miles west of central London.The bells of St. George’s will chime to mark the happy event, but the cash tills are already ringing. Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.

Kristin Barnaby, a self-described arachnophobe, found a way to overcome what she dreads at a North Carolina burger joint.“I am going to eat my fear,” the 27-year-old said at the Bull City Burger and Brewery, where she tucked into a hamburger topped with a crunchy full-grown, oven-roasted tarantula.Tarantulas made their debut after restaurant owner Seth Gross read about how they have become a street food staple in Cambodia, where they are mixed with salt and sugar and cooked.The tarantula burger is not for everyone. Gross gets only 15 of the farmed, organically raised creatures each year, so diners need to be lucky, as well as daring, to get a taste.“You come in, you fill in a lottery ticket,” he said. “If we draw your name, you come and get to eat one.”The lucky winners have up to 48 hours to claim their prize and Gross said none have yet backed out.（Reuters）

No one told them it was gonna be this way.Millions of Chinese "Friends" fans are heartbroken after top portal Sohu, citing only "copyright issues" in April, abruptly pulled the US sitcom, beloved by millennials in China for its endearing characters and as an English conversation resource.The move has touched off anguish on Chinese social media sites such as Weibo, where a "Friends offline" hashtag has generated millions of posts. Many have called for Sohu to re-up on its "Friends" rights, with others indicating where to download pirated episodes.Millions of Chinese youngsters identify with the theme song’s lament － "your job’s a joke, you’re broke, your love life’s DOA." And they grab the chance to burnish their American-style English. "There are so much conversational English in it; things that you can’t learn from books."Some English training courses in China even assign the show as teaching material.

More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as "mind-boggling". Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit. But the research, published in the journal Current Biology, also revealed that animals were "disappearing" from areas that remained forested.This implied large numbers of orangutans were simply being slaughtered, said lead researcher Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. She said the animals are being targeted by hunters and are being killed in retaliation for crop-raiding.Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, UK said： "When these animals come into conflict with people on the edge of a plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we had a report of an orangutan that had 130 pellets in its body, after being shot."Deforestation alone could wipe out a further 45,000 orangutans over the next 35 years. 


自1999年以來，超過10萬隻極度瀕危的紅毛猩猩在婆羅洲遭殺害，研究顯示。在該島進行16年調查的科學家形容，這個數字「令人難以接受」。因伐木、（種植）油棕、採礦以及造紙業而驅動的森林砍伐，仍是主要的罪魁禍首。然而，這份刊登在「當代生物學」期刊的研究也披露，該動物仍從森林覆蓋的地區「逐漸消失」。這意味著為數可觀的紅毛猩猩就是遭屠殺，首席研究員、德國「馬克斯．普朗克進化人類學研究所」的沃伊特說。她指出，紅毛猩猩被獵人鎖定並格殺，以報復其危害作物。英國利物浦約翰摩爾斯大學教授威齊指出：「當這些動物在種植園邊緣與人類發生衝突時，人們將殺掉牠們。就在上週，我們獲報有隻紅毛猩猩遭射殺，身上有130顆彈丸。」單是砍伐森林，便可能在未來35年進一步毀滅4萬5000隻紅毛猩猩。


研究显示，自1999年以来，婆罗洲有超过100,000只严重濒危的猩猩死亡。在岛上进行为期16年的调查的科学家称这一数字“令人难以置信”。由伐木，油棕，采矿和造纸厂驱动的砍伐森林仍然是主要的罪魁祸首。但该研究发表在“当代生物学”杂志上，也揭示了动物在仍然是森林的地区“消失”。这意味着大量的猩猩只是被屠杀，马克斯普朗克进化人类学研究所的首席研究员玛丽亚福伊特说。德国。她说这些动物是猎人的目标，并因作物捕杀报复而被杀害。英国利物浦约翰摩尔斯大学的Serge Serge Wich说：“当这些动物与种植园边缘的人发生冲突时，人们会杀死他们，就在上个星期，我们收到一条猩猩的报告，在被枪杀后，它的体内有130颗粒。“仅在今后的35年里，森林砍伐就可能使另外45,000只猩猩丧生。

Hot peppers aren’t just a pain in the mouth — they may be a pain in the head, too. After eating the hottest known pepper in the world, a man suffered from splitting headaches that drove him to the hospital emergency room, and into case-study history.His is the first known instance of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome — a temporary narrowing of arteries in the brain — to be tied to eating a hot pepper, researchers report April 9 in British Medical Journal Case Reports. Such narrowed arteries can lead to severe pain called “thunderclap headaches” and are often associated with pregnancy complications or illicit drug use.During a hot-pepper-eating contest, the man ate a chili dubbed the Carolina Reaper, named by Guinness World Records as the hottest pepper in the world. The Carolina Reaper is over 200 times as spicy as a jalapeno. About a minute later, he reported experiencing splitting headaches that came and went over two days before he sought treatment.Initial tests failed to find anything out of the ordinary. But a CT scan of blood vessels in the man’s brain showed severely narrowed arteries. When the researchers imaged his brain five weeks later, the arteries had returned to their normal size.


辣椒不只能讓嘴巴發疼，也可能造成頭痛。一名男子在食用被稱為全球最辣的辣椒後，頭痛欲裂到不得不去掛急診，而被記載於個案研究史冊。他的案例是迄今首例與吃辣椒有關的可逆性腦血管收縮症候群，即一種暫時性的腦動脈收縮，研究人員4月9日刊登在《英國醫學期刊病例報告》的研究指出。此類動脈收縮會導致劇烈疼痛，也被稱為「霹靂頭疼」，通常與妊娠併發症或使用違禁藥物有關。該名男子在吃辣椒比賽上食用被金氏世界紀錄評選為地表上最辣辣椒的「卡羅萊納死神」辣椒。卡羅萊納死神比「墨西哥辣椒」辣上逾200倍。他宣稱吃完辣椒1分鐘後便感到頭痛欲裂，而且在尋求治療之前，這種情況持續2天之久。初步檢查並未發現異狀。但該名男子的腦部血管電腦斷層掃描顯示，多處動脈出現收縮情況。研究人員5週後再次檢查其腦內影像時，則發現動脈已恢復原本大小。


辣椒不仅仅是口中的疼痛 - 它们也可能是头部疼痛。在吃了世界上最知名的辣椒之后，一个患有头痛的人将他赶到医院的急诊室，并进入病例研究的历史。他是第一个已知的可逆性脑血管收缩综合征 - 一种暂时性的动脉缩窄研究人员在4月9日的英国医学期刊病例报告中报告说，大脑 - 与吃辣椒有关。这种狭窄的动脉可导致严重的疼痛，称为“霹雳头痛”，通常与妊娠并发症或非法药物使用有关。在辣椒食用比赛中，该男子吃了被称为吉尼斯世界纪录的Carolina Reaper的辣椒世界上最辣的辣椒。卡罗来纳州收割者比墨西哥辣椒辣了200倍以上。大约一分钟后，他报告说，在他寻求治疗前两天，他遇到了分裂性头痛，并且已经过去了。初步检查未能发现任何异常情况。但是该男子脑部血管的CT扫描显示动脉严重狭窄。当研究人员在五周后对他的大脑进行成像时，动脉已恢复到正常大小。

President Moon Jae-in’s approval rating has shot up to an 11-month high this week, a poll showed Thursday, following his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.In a survey conducted by Realmeter, 78.3 percent of respondents said they approved of the way the president managed state affairs. The latest figure apparently reflects the people’s approval of the outcome of the inter-Korean summit.In a separate survey conducted by Realmeter, 71.4 percent of 501 respondents said they believe the North will actually denuclearize this time around in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way. The approval rating of the ruling Democratic Party also enjoyed a sharp increase, advancing 2.7 percentage points to 54.9 percent from a week earlier. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party’s rating, on the other hand, slipped 3.2 percentage points to 17.9 percent.

Supermarket shoppers in the western German city of Aachen have stepped out of their comfort zone to sample insect burgers made of buffalo worms.The worms, highly nutritious due to their high protein content, are the larvae of buffalo beetles and are bred in the Netherlands.Served in rolls with lettuce, onions and tomatoes, they are being offered to customers at a supermarket in Aachen after proving successful in the Netherlands and Belgium.One passerby who tried one of the burgers, Manfred Roedder, said he believed they were a good alternative to meat, adding: "I had reservations at first but I got a second serving because it tasted so good."Baris Oezel, one of the founders of the start-up called Bugfoundation that makes the burgers, said he spent four years working on the concept along with company co-founder Max Kraemer."It’s quite simple. You have to create an aesthetic product that looks good and doesn’t show any insects," Oezel said, adding that people were attracted by the smell of the burgers. (Reuters) 


德國西部亞琛市的超級市場消費者踏出了他們的舒適圈，品嚐水牛蠕蟲製成的昆蟲漢堡。因蛋白質含量高而極度營養的這些蠕蟲，是水牛甲蟲的幼蟲，於荷蘭繁殖培育。用萵苣、洋蔥和蕃茄包捲上菜，在荷蘭和比利時證明成功後，它們被供應給亞琛一家超市的顧客。試過其中一個漢堡的路人曼弗雷德．勒德爾說，他相信它們是替代肉類的好選擇，並補充指出：「我最初持保留態度，但我吃了第二份，因為它吃起來好棒。」製作這些漢堡的新創公司「蟲蟲基金會」的成立者之一巴利斯．歐澤爾說，他花了4年時間和公司共同創辦人馬克斯．克拉瑪構思出這個概念。歐澤爾說，「相當簡單。你必須創造一個有美感的產品，好看但不要露出任何昆蟲」，並補充指出，人們受到這些漢堡味道的吸引。（路透）

An overpowering stench of raw garbage, cockroaches scuttling up the walls and junk piled high in every nook and cranny：It’s hard to believe that anyone would call it home.Welcome to a typical "trash house," a term coined for dwellings whose residents seem to have given up on basic norms of hygiene by throwing nothing away.It is a growing problem for local authorities across Japan faced with clearing out these homes so the occupants can put their lives back together.Dementia and depression can be factors behind hoarding, but there are also other causes.The son of a woman in her 80s living alone in Osaka Prefecture got the shock of his life on a rare visit home to find an awful mess inside.It wasn’t just the smell of garbage, or the flies and the cockroaches. The dining room was piled 30 centimeters high with everything from a carton of eggs to dirty bed linen and a cookbook.


令人無法忍受的生廚餘惡臭、竄爬上牆的蟑螂，以及堆得到處都是的垃圾，令人難以想像有人能將此處稱之為家。歡迎來到典型的「垃圾屋」，這是專為看似放棄基本衛生準則、什麼東西都不丟掉的居住者的住處所打造的詞彙。「垃圾屋」問題令日本各地方政府愈來愈頭大，得清理這些住處好讓居住者能回歸正常生活。失智與憂鬱可能是（導致）居家囤積垃圾的因素，但也還有其他原因。大阪府1名80多歲獨居老嫗的兒子難得造訪母親的家，結果發現家裡一團亂而嚇了一大跳。令人驚嚇的不只是垃圾的惡臭或蒼蠅與蟑螂。堆積在餐廳的垃圾足足有30公分高，從一盒蛋到髒床單與食譜什麼都有。

When Lebanese chef Alan Geaam first arrived in Paris two decades ago he found himself sleeping on the streets, lost and penniless with hardly a word of French.Geaam, who began his career as a dishwasher, finally received his first Michelin star from the French gastronomic bible for his acclaimed new restaurant.In the childhood Geaam had a fascination with food, watching cookery shows on television rather than cartoons after school. He started cooking while doing his national service in Lebanon, and the colonel of his regiment was so impressed he made him his personal chef.But Geaam never thought he would be able to cut the mustard in France. "I worked during the day as a construction worker and at night delivering pizzas and washing dishes. One night the cook cut his hand and had to go to hospital. No one asked me, but I just took over. There were 14 tables and I just feed the customers and at the end of the night they were delighted."


黎巴嫩裔廚師艾倫．吉姆20年前初到巴黎時，身無分文只能露宿街頭，而且法語一竅不通，找不到人生方向。從擔任一名洗碗工開始打拚事業的吉姆，憑藉備受讚揚的新餐廳，終於首度榮獲法國飲食界聖經「米其林」的一星評價。吉姆從小便著迷於食物，放學後看電視不是看卡通，而是烹飪節目。他在黎巴嫩服役時開始下廚，讓隊裡的上校印象深刻，還邀請他擔任私人廚師。然而，吉姆來到法國後不曾想過自己夠資格下廚。「我白天是建築工，晚上去送披薩和洗碗。有一晚，廚師切傷手進了醫院。雖然沒人問我，但我接手他的工作。當時有14桌客人，我就煮給他們吃，最後他們吃得很盡興。」


二十年前，当黎巴嫩厨师Alan Geaam第一次来到巴黎时，他发现自己在街头流浪，失去了身无分文的法语.Geaam最初是一名洗碗机，最后他从法国美食学院获得了他的第一颗米其林星级圣经为他着名的新餐厅。童年Geaam有食物的魅力，看电视上的烹饪节目，而不是放学后的漫画。他在黎巴嫩服役期间开始烹饪，他的团队上校对他的个人厨师印象深刻，他让他成为他的私人厨师。但是基亚姆从来没有想过他能够切断法国的芥末。 “我白天做一名建筑工人，晚上做比萨饼和洗盘子，一天晚上厨师剪了手，不得不去医院，没有人问我，但我刚接手，有14张桌子，我只是为客户提供食物，在晚上他们很高兴。“

Sculpture artists gathered in Scotland on Sunday to compete for the title of champion stone stacker. More than 30 participants from America, Spain, Italy and from around Britain converged on Dunbar, near Edinburgh, for the second European Stone Stacking Championships. Competitors must create the most complex and gravity-defying artistic sculptures from rocks and pebbles gathered on the town’s Eye Cave Beach. "（It’s） the most ancient art form that there is," James Craig Page, the fledgling contest’s founder, said. Stone stacking however has angered some conservationists who accuse enthusiasts of "rubbing out history" by removing rocks from ancient neolithic monuments. Page insists the professional artists take care to preserve the natural and historic environment. Pedro Duran, from Spain, was named European champion for the second year running for his stone archway, while James Brunt, 46, from the English city Sheffield, won runner-up for his intricate sculpture of a rollercoaster. "I got into stone stacking about seven years ago," said Brunt. "Everyone thought it was a kind of magic, and I saw the science behind it."


雕塑藝術家週日齊聚蘇格蘭，為堆石頭冠軍頭銜一較高下。逾30名來自美國、西班牙、義大利及英國各地的參賽者，為了第二屆歐洲堆石錦標賽，聚集在愛丁堡附近的鄧巴。參賽者必須以取自該鎮眼洞海灘的石塊與小卵石，創造出最複雜與挑戰地心引力的藝術雕塑。「這是現存最古老的藝術形式。」這個剛起步的競賽創辦人佩吉說。然而，堆石頭激怒一些生態保育人士，他們指控狂熱份子搬動新石器時代遺址的石塊，「抹除歷史」。佩吉堅稱，專業的藝術家會小心維護自然與歷史環境。來自西班牙的杜蘭以他的石頭拱門，連續第二年獲頒歐洲冠軍；現年46歲、來自英國城市雪菲爾的布朗特，則以他複雜精細的雲霄飛車雕塑贏得亞軍。「約在7年前我對堆石產生興趣，」 布朗特說。「大家以為這是一種魔術，但我看到背後的科學。」


周日，苏格兰的雕塑艺术家聚集在一起，争夺冠军石头堆积者的头衔。来自美国，西班牙，意大利和英国各地的30多名参赛者聚集在爱丁堡附近的邓巴举办第二届欧洲石牌堆叠锦标赛。参赛者必须从城镇的眼洞海滩聚集的石块和鹅卵石制作出最复杂，最具挑战性的艺术雕塑。 “（这是）最古老的艺术形式，”羽翼未丰的比赛创始人詹姆斯克雷格佩奇说。然而，石材堆放激怒了一些环保主义者，他们指责发烧友通过从古代新石器时代纪念碑中移除岩石来“剔除历史”。页面坚持专业艺术家注意保护自然和历史环境。来自西班牙的佩德罗杜兰因其石拱门而连续第二年获得欧洲冠军，而来自英国谢菲尔德市的46岁的詹姆斯布伦特因其精湛的过山车雕塑而获得亚军。 “我大约七年前就进入了石头堆积，”布伦特说。 “每个人都认为这是一种魔术，我看到了它背后的科学。”

Migrants hoping to start a new life in New Zealand can add a new skill to their visa applications. Under a new plan, would-be immigrants can claim points as skilled sex workers and escorts.According to information on Immigration New Zealand’s website, sex work is listed as ANZSCO level 5 skilled employment, and applicants could claim points towards their VISA if they are paid at or above NZ$ 36.44 per hour. They should also have relevant recognized qualifications or have at least three years of work experience in the relevant industry. But New Zealand Association of Migration and Investment（NZAMI）spokesperson Peter Moses said prostitution is listed as skilled employment, but applying for a resident visa as a sex worker would still be extremely difficult. Escort and sex work are on the skilled employment list, but they are not included on the skill-shortage list.


希望在紐西蘭展開新生活的移民，可在簽證申請表上增加一項新技能。根據一項新的計畫，準移民能以有技術的性工作者及伴遊身分要求加分。紐西蘭移民資訊網站顯示，性工作被列為「澳紐標準職業分類」第5級技術性職業，申請者只要時薪36.44紐幣以上，即可就其簽證要求加分。他們也應擁有相關認證資格，或有相關產業至少3年工作經驗。


希望在新西兰开始新生活的移民可以为他们的签证申请增加一项新技能。根据一项新计划，即将入境的移民可以获得积分作为熟练的性工作者和护送人员。根据新西兰移民局网站上的信息，性工作被列为ANZSCO第5级熟练工，并且申请人可以向VISA申请积分支付每小时36.44新元或以上。他们还应具有相关的认可资格，或在相关行业至少有三年的工作经验。但新西兰移民与投资协会（NZAMI）发言人彼得摩西表示，卖淫被列为熟练工，但申请居民签证作为性工作者仍然非常困难。护卫和性工作都在熟练的就业名单上，但他们不包括在技能短缺名单中。

Night owls may be more fun at parties, but a preference for staying out late may come with some serious drawbacks, suggests a new study published this week in Chronobiology International.Researchers looked data from a large, ongoing population study of UK residents, known as the UK Biobank Study. Around a half a million participants enrolled in the study from 2006 to 2010 and have had their health tracked ever since. In the current study, the researchers specifically looked at over 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 to 73 who answered a question about whether they were a morning or evening type, then followed them for an average 6.5 years.Over 10,000 of those people died during the study period. And compared to people who described themselves as definite morning people, night owls were about 10 percent more likely to have died. More than that, night owls were also just generally unhealthier.According to the authors, it’s the first to suggest that gastrointestinal and neurological problems are more common among owls.


夜貓子更能在派對上玩開，然其對熬夜的偏好，可能招致若干嚴重的壞處，一項本週發表於《國際時間生物學》期刊的新研究指出。研究人員檢視一項持續進行中的大型英國居民人口研究「英國人體生物資料庫」的數據。自2006年至2010年，約有50萬人報名參與這項研究，啟動他們的健康情況追蹤。在該次研究中，研究人員聚焦於年齡介於38歲至73歲、曾自述為晨型人或夜型人的逾40萬名志願者，平均追蹤他們6.5年。研究期間，這些志願者中有超過1萬人逝世。而相較於明確形容自己為晨型人的志願者，夜貓子的死亡機率高出約10％。不僅如此，夜貓子也普遍地更不健康。這項研究的作者指出，該研究首次顯示夜貓子更常有胃腸和神經問題。


夜猫子在派对上可能会更有趣，但是对于迟到的偏好可能会带来一些严重的缺陷，建议本周在Chronobiology International上发布一项新的研究。研究人员查看了一项正在进行的大规模英国居民人口研究的数据，英国生物银行研究。从2006年到2010年，约有50万参与者参加了这项研究，并从此开始追踪他们的健康状况。在目前的研究中，研究人员专门研究了40岁以上的38岁至73岁的志愿者，他们回答了他们是否是早上或晚上类型的问题，然后跟踪他们平均6。5年。这些人中有超过1万人死于研究期间。与那些将自己描述为明确的早晨人群的人相比，夜猫子的死亡可能性大约为10％。不仅如此，夜猫子通常也不健康。据作者说，这是第一个表明猫头鹰中胃肠和神经问题更为常见的病例。

The North has conducted its all six nuclear detonations at the Punggye-ri facility in North Hamgyong Province. Last month, the U.S.-based North Korean analysis website 38 North assessed that the reduction in activity could be attributed to recent diplomacy between Pyongyang and Seoul and Washington."It appears that the North is trying to show that its proposal to denuclearize is not an empty promise," Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies, said.The head of South Korea’s weather agency, Korea Meteorological Administration, warned last year during a parliamentary meeting that another nuclear blast could trigger a collapse of the North’s mountainous test site and a leak of radioactive materials. Geological experts have raised concerns that the site’s nuclear tests may have influenced volcanic activities in the nearby Mt.Paekdu, which can lead to serious environmental consequences.


北韓迄今的6次核子試爆，均在咸鏡北道豐溪里核試場進行。上月份，位在美國的北韓事務分析網站「北緯38度」研判，北韓核子相關活動的減少，可能與近來平壤和首爾、華府之間的外交接觸有關。南韓「北韓大學院大學」教授楊武仁（譯音）說，「北韓似乎正試圖展現，它的非核化提議並非空頭承諾。」南韓氣象當局「氣象廳」廳長去年曾在國會會議中警告，再有一次核試，恐引發位處山區的豐溪里核試場崩塌及輻射物質外洩。地質專家擔憂，在當地核試可能影響附近白頭山的火山活動，可能對環境造成嚴重後果。


北部在咸镜北部的丰业里设施进行了六次核爆炸。上个月，总部位于美国的北韩分析网站38North评估说，活动的减少可能是由于平壤，首尔和华盛顿之间最近的外交所致。“看起来，北韩试图表明它的无核化建议不是朝鲜研究院教授杨谟金说。韩国气象局局长韩国气象局去年在一次议会会议上警告说，另一次核爆炸可能会引发北部的山区试验场和放射性物质泄漏。地质专家担心该场址的核试验可能会影响附近Mt.Paekdu山的火山活动，这可能会导致严重的环境后果。

A man in northeastern China who always wanted to own an aircraft is doing the next best thing：building a full-scale replica of an Airbus A320 jet.Zhu Yue, an aviation buff who worked as a welder and an auto mechanic, spent months studying plane models and technical drawings before he started building a homemade version a year ago with his friends.Zhu, 40, who lives in the city of Kaiyuan in Liaoning province, said he planned to turn the replica into an aviation-themed restaurant."I want to make sure the plane is created with finesse and be the best A320 model in China," he said.The replica - 37.8 meters long with a wingspan of 36 meters and height of 12 meters - will feature model engine turbines that can rotate and a simulation cockpit, he added.Zhu, who has so far spent more than 1 million yuan of his savings and used 40 tonnes of steel on his project, hopes to complete it by the end of year at a total cost of 2 million yuan. （Reuters） 


中國東北一位一直想要擁有一架飛機的男子，正進行退而求其次的方案：打造一架空中巴士A320噴射機的原尺寸仿製品。朱躍，一名擔任焊工和汽車技工的飛機迷，在他1年前和朋友們開始打造手工版本前，花了數個月研究飛機模型與工程製圖。40歲的朱躍住在遼寧省開原市，他說計畫把這架仿製品變身為一間飛機主題餐廳。他說：「我想確保這架飛機製造精美，並且是中國最棒的A320模型。」他補充，這件仿製品——37.8公尺長，翼展36公尺，以及12公尺高——將主打可旋轉的模型渦輪引擎以及模擬駕駛艙。朱躍至今已在他的計畫投入超過100萬人民幣積蓄及40公噸的鋼材，希望在年底前以總造價200萬人民幣完成它。（路透）


中国东北部一直想拥有一架飞机的男士正在做的第二件事是：制造一架空中客车A320喷气式飞机的全面复制品。作为焊工和汽车修理工的航空爱好者朱跃花了几个月的时间学习飞机模型和技术图纸，一年前他和他的朋友们开始制作自制版本。居住在辽宁省开元市的朱，40岁，他表示他计划把复制品变成一个以航空为主题的餐厅。“我希望确保飞机的制造精良，并成为中国最好的A320飞机型号。“他说。副翼 -  37.8米长，翼展36米，高12米 - 将配备可旋转的模型发动机涡轮机一个模拟驾驶舱。他补充说。迄今为止，他的储蓄已经花费了100多万元人民币，并且在他的项目中使用了40吨钢材，他希望在年底之前完成该项目，总成本为200万元人民币。 （路透社）

一名（日本）高速新幹線子彈列車的駕駛員坦承，他在4月1日駛進JR仙台站時睡著，衝過停車點。這列東北新幹線列車以高於正常的速度抵達該站，迫使車掌啟動緊急煞車。根據負責營運的JR東日本鐵路公司仙台支社4月13日的說法，該列車最後在超出指定停車點20公尺處停下，還被迫倒車。起初，該名40幾歲的駕駛員表示，他弄錯了停車點。但在4月13日，他坦承當時在打瞌睡。該列車搭載約500名旅客，所幸無人因此受傷。仙台支社表示，這班「山彥」59號列車從東京出發，目的地是盛岡。此事發生在晚間約10時20分。

Mao Shan Wang, a Singapore eatery themed with durian, has caught the opportunity of success as patrons flock to the cafe in droves for a bite of its exotic offerings.The pungent tropical fruit long regarded as a delicacy in Southeast Asia has left a divisive trail － you either love it or hate it.Detractors often describe its intense smell as a mix of gym socks and onions, while enthusiasts liken the creamy texture and intense aroma to blue cheese.While the "bittersweet" fruit is usually eaten on its own or as dessert, the Mao Shan Wang cafe has a special menu with durian in all dishes.Customers can opt for chicken nuggets with a durian dip, pizza topped with durian flesh, all washed down with coffee － durian infused, of course."What our company wanted to do was put it with savory stuff like fries and nuggets. We will be looking to expand the offerings as well, with maybe rice, pasta and other things," company spokesman Lance Lee said.


「貓山王」是新加坡一家榴槤主題餐廳，隨著饕客蜂擁而至想一嚐異國風味料理，這家餐廳抓住了成功的契機。這種味道具刺激性的熱帶水果，長期被視為東南亞的佳餚，但也引發兩極意見——不是喜愛就是討厭。討厭的人通常將榴槤強烈的味道，形容為體育館裡的襪子和洋蔥的混合物，喜愛的人則將其綿密的果肉和濃郁的香氣，與藍紋乳酪相提並論。雖然這種「愛恨分明」的水果通常都是直接吃或做成甜點，但貓山王的特別菜單上有著用榴槤做成的各種菜餚。顧客可選擇搭配榴槤沾醬的炸雞、鋪滿榴槤果肉的披薩，或者隨著咖啡一飲而盡——榴槤當然加在裡頭。該店發言人蘭斯．李表示：「我們的店想主打結合榴槤和薯條、炸雞等鹹食的餐點。我們也會嘗試擴增菜單，可能與米飯、義大利麵和其他食物一起搭配。」


以榴莲为主题的新加坡餐馆毛山王，抓住了成功的机会，因为顾客蜂拥而至，挤满了咖啡馆，吃了一口其异国情调的东西。长期以来在东南亚被视为美味的辛辣热带水果已经留下了一条分裂的道路 - 你要么喜欢它，要么讨厌它。修饰者通常将其强烈的气味描述为健身袜和洋葱的混合物，而热爱者将奶油质地和强烈的香气比作蓝乳酪。虽然“苦乐参半”的水果通常自己吃，或者作为甜点，毛山王咖啡馆在所有菜肴中都有榴莲的特别菜单。顾客可以选择带有榴莲蘸料的鸡块，披上榴莲肉的披萨，当然都是用咖啡 - 榴莲注入。“公司发言人Lance Lee说，公司想要做的就是将薯条和金块等咸味食品放入其中，我们也希望扩大产品范围，包括大米，面食和其他东西，“公司发言人Lance Lee说。

Visitors to a zoo in southeastern China killed one kangaroo and injured another by throwing bricks at them in an attempt to get a reaction from the big marsupials, state media reported. A 12-year-old female kangaroo suffered a severely injured foot when it was struck by bricks and concrete chunks on February 28 at the Fuzhou Zoo in Fujian province, China Central Television reported. The kangaroo died days later and an examination by a veterinarian revealed that the cause of death was likely a ruptured kidney caused by being struck by the projectiles. A few weeks later, a five-year-old male kangaroo at the same zoo was slightly injured in a similar way, said the report. The report included pictures of the first kangaroo’s smashed and nearly severed foot, and of the animal receiving treatment via intravenous drip before it died. Visitors to the zoo were known to try to provoke the Australia marsupials to get them to display their signature hopping mode of locomotion using their powerful hind legs. The report did not mention whether anyone was punished over the matter, but it said the dead female would be stuffed and put on display and the zoo would look to install security cameras to deter visitors from harming animals. 


中國東南部一座動物園的遊客對袋鼠丟磚塊，試圖獲取這類大型有袋動物的反應，結果砸死一頭袋鼠，並砸傷另一頭，國營媒體報導。12歲的母袋鼠2月28日在福建省福州動物園被磚頭與水泥塊擊中，腳部重傷，中國中央電視台報導。這頭袋鼠幾天後死亡，獸醫的檢查揭示，死因可能是被拋射物擊中而導致腎臟破裂。幾週後，同一座動物園的5歲公袋鼠也因類似情況受到輕傷，報導指出。報導包括第一頭袋鼠遭猛擊、幾近斷裂的腳，以及牠死前接受靜脈點滴治療的照片。眾所周知，該動物園的遊客會試圖刺激這種澳洲有袋動物，讓牠們以有力後腿展現其招牌跳躍的移動模式。報導並未提及是否有任何人因此事受罰，僅表示死亡的母袋鼠將被填充並陳列展示，動物園也將裝設監視器，以遏阻遊客傷害動物。


官方媒体报道，去中国东南部动物园的游客为了试图从大型有袋动物身上得到反应，杀死了一只袋鼠，并给他们扔砖头而使另一只受伤。据中央电视台报道，一只12岁的女袋鼠在2月28日在福建省福州动物园被砖块和混凝土块击中时脚受重伤。几天后，袋鼠死亡，兽医检查发现死亡原因可能是被射弹击中造成的肾脏破裂。报道说，几周后，在同一动物园的一只五岁的雄性袋鼠受到类似的伤害。这份报告包括第一只袋鼠被撞碎和几乎断裂的脚的照片，以及在死亡前通过静脉滴注接受治疗的动物的照片。知道动物园的游客试图挑起澳大利亚有袋动物，让他们用强大的后腿展示他们的运动标志性跳跃模式。该报道没有提到是否有人受到处罚，但它说死去的女性会被塞进并展示，动物园会安装安全摄像头来阻止访客伤害动物。

Six out of Australia’s eight states and territories are currently experiencing a man drought, according to McCrindle Research — and there are almost 100,000 more women than men."The man drought is a demographic reality," Australian social researcher Mark McCrindle said the country has 100,000 more females than males even though there are more male babies born than females. One of the reasons is because men are increasingly heading overseas to work.Sydney on the whole has 98.5 men for every 100 women. The city is experiencing a severe man drought, with some areas having as few as 86 men for every 100 women. Hardest hit states include Tasmania and Victoria, where every single town is experiencing a man drought. The man drought combined with women making up 60 per cent of university graduates left many unable to find a qualified man. Women prefer partners with an equal or higher level of education, but as they now outnumber men with degrees they may need to look elsewhere. 


據「麥克蘭登研究所」調查，澳洲8個州和領地中，有6個正陷入男人荒，女性比男性多出近10萬人。「男人荒是人口統計上的現實」，澳洲社會研究員馬克．麥克蘭登表示，該國女性比男性多出10萬人，即便男嬰多於女嬰。原因之一是前往海外工作的男性愈來愈多。雪梨的整體男女比例為98.5比100。該城市正面臨嚴重男人荒，部分地區男女比例低至86比100。衝擊最嚴重的州包括塔斯馬尼亞州及維多利亞州，當地每個城鎮都陷入男人荒。男人荒，加上女性在大學畢業生中佔60%，導致許多女性無法找到合格對象。女性偏好同等或較高教育水準的伴侶，但由於如今她們擁有學位的人數超過男性，她們可能得到別地尋偶。


根据McCrindle Research的数据，澳大利亚八个州和领地中有六个目前正在经历一场人类干旱 - 而且女性人口数量比男性多出十万人。“澳大利亚社会研究人员马克麦克林德尔说，该国的人口干旱是一个人口现实，尽管出生的男婴比女婴多，但女性多于男性。其中一个原因是因为男性越来越多地去海外工作。悉尼每100名女性就有98.5名男性。该市正在经历严重的人类干旱，一些地区每100名妇女只有86人。最受打击的国家包括塔斯马尼亚和维多利亚，每个城镇都经历着一场人类干旱。男性干旱加上占60％大学毕业生的女性，使许多人无法找到合格的男性。女性更喜欢受过相同或更高等级教育的合作伙伴，但由于他们现在超过了拥有学位的男性，他们可能需要在别处寻找。

If you want to help abandoned dogs find new homes, take part in overseas adoption programs. The voluntary program has recently been organized by animal rights groups in Korea. Previously it was sporadically done by pet lovers.All medical treatments and quarantine procedures ahead, and at the end, of the trips as well as flight expenses for the dogs will be covered by the rights groups that have organized the project. If the volunteers take the dogs with them on their flights, the fee per animal is 200,000 won."Some dogs rescued from dog meat farms weigh about 20 kilograms and the price of shipping them in the cargo bay is over 1 million won," said Melissa Baek, an animal rights activist with Animal Peace Korea. "These larger dogs are not being adopted in Korea because domestic adopters living in apartments prefer small dogs."


若你想幫遭棄養的狗狗找個新家，就加入海外收養計畫。在南韓，該志願計畫近來已由動物權團體籌組，過去則是個別喜愛寵物的人士所為。狗狗所有事前和到達目的地後的醫療與檢疫程序及搭機費用，均由籌組該計畫的動物權團體支付。若志工帶這些狗狗一起搭機，每隻狗需20萬韓元。「韓國動物和平」組織的動物保育人士梅麗莎．白表示，「有些從狗肉場救出的狗，體重約20公斤，置於班機貨艙托運需上百萬韓元」，「韓國國內住在公寓的領養人，較偏好小型犬，所以國內目前不會收養這些大型犬」。


如果你想帮助被遗弃的狗找到新家，参加海外收养计划。最近由韩国的动物权利组织组织了自愿方案。此前，它是由宠物爱好者零星地完成的。所有的医疗和检疫程序提前，并在最后，旅行和狗的飞行费用将由组织该项目的权利组织覆盖。如果这些志愿者在他们的航班上带着他们的狗，每只动物的费用是200,000韩元。“有些从狗肉养殖场救出的狗重约20公斤，在货舱中运输它们的价格超过100万韩元。” Animal Peace Korea动物权利活动家Melissa Baek。 “这些较大的狗在韩国没有被采用，因为居住在公寓的国内采用者更喜欢小狗。”

Take the highway past the Dutch village of Jelsum and the road will play you a tune.Created by strategically laid "rumble strips" as a way of livening up journeys across the flat landscape, the novelty has worn thin for locals who say the constant droning melody is driving them mad.The tune is created when car tyres drive over the strips - which are usually deployed at the side of major roads to warn drivers they are straying off course.If hit at the correct speed - the 60 kph limit - the road will sing out the anthem of the Friesland region - a northern part of the Netherlands that has a distinct language and culture.But it is loud and the sound travels, and locals say the musical road had created a never-ending cacophony that keeps them awake at night.The Friesland authority has agreed to remove the rumble strips later this week. （Reuters） 


取道那條行經荷蘭耶爾瑟姆村的公路，它將為你奏上一曲。由策略性鋪設的「減速標線」所製造出的歌曲，是讓橫越那段平坦風景的路程充滿生氣的方式，但這條新奇道路已讓當地人們興味索然，他們說持續嗡嗡作響的旋律要把他們逼瘋了。曲調會在汽車輪胎壓過標線時揚出，這些標線通常配置於主要道路旁，以警告駕駛他們正偏離道路。若以正確速度壓過標線——時速60公里上限——這條路會唱出荷蘭北部擁有不同語言和文化的菲士蘭地區省歌。但音量很大且聲音四傳，當地人說，這條聲音美妙的道路造成了讓他們夜間醒來的無盡雜音。菲士蘭當局已同意本週稍後拆掉這段減速標線。（路透）


通过高速公路穿过荷兰村庄耶尔苏姆，路上会播放你的曲调。通过策略性地设置“隆隆带”作为一种在平坦的景观中激活旅程的方式来创建的，对于说持续不断的嗡嗡声的当地人来说，旋律驱使他们发疯。这个曲调是在汽车轮胎驶过条带时产生的 - 这些条带通常部署在主要道路旁，以警告他们偏离航线的驾驶员。如果以正确的速度--60公里的限制 - 公路将唱出弗里斯兰地区的歌 - 荷兰北部有着独特的语言和文化。但它很响亮，声音传播，当地人说音乐之路造成了一个永无止境的喧嚣，使他们在晚上醒来。弗里斯兰当局同意在本周晚些时候消除隆隆声。 （路透社）

When Dawa Yangzum Sherpa first set her sights on being a mountain guide, she was told it was no job for a girl.Now the 27-year-old completed a rigorous course run by the Swiss-based International Federation of Mountain Guides, often described as a PhD in mountaineering, becoming Nepal’s first woman to earn an international qualificationDawa belongs to the Himalayan ethnic group Sherpa, which has become synonymous with mountain guiding thanks to their reputation for being strong climbers with a natural tolerance for the lack of oxygen at high altitudes. But in Nepal － home to eight of the world’s highest mountains － climbing remains a man’s job.After racking up a number of summits of smaller mountains, in 2012 Dawa was selected to join an expedition organized by National Geographic to the world’s highest peak."Everest was my aim. I used to think that once I scale Everest it will be enough. But climbing is like an addiction. The more I climbed, the more I wanted to climb," she said.


達瓦．揚格札姆．雪巴初次將登山嚮導視為志向時，大家都告訴她這不是女孩子該做的工作。27歲的她如今完成瑞士「國際高山嚮導協會」承辦，通常被形容為登山界博士學位的嚴苛課程，成為首位取得國際認證的尼泊爾女性。達瓦是喜馬拉雅山雪巴族成員，該族群在氧氣稀薄的高山地區具有天生的適應力，以強健登山者聞名，已是高山嚮導的同義詞。但在世界排名前八大高山林立的尼泊爾，登山向來是男人的工作。在累計許多較小型山脈的登頂經驗後，「國家地理頻道」2012年選中達瓦加入其籌組的全球最高峰遠征隊。她說：「艾佛勒斯峰是我的目標。我以前認為，一旦我征服艾佛勒斯峰，就會心滿意足。但登山會上癮。我爬得愈多，就愈想再爬。」


当Dawa Yangzum Sherpa第一次将自己的目光瞄准了一个登山导游时，她被告知这对一个女孩来说是没有任何工作的。现在这个27岁的孩子完成了一个由瑞士国际山地协会组织的严格课程，作为登山学博士，成为尼泊尔第一位获得国际资格的女性大瓦属于喜马拉雅山脉族群夏尔巴，由于他们是一名强壮的登山者，因为他们对高海拔地区缺乏氧气有着天生的忍耐力，这已成为登山指导的代名词。 。但在尼泊尔 - 拥有世界上最高的八座山峰 - 登山仍然是一个男人的工作。2012年，Dawa被选为加入由国家地理组织的世界最高峰组织的远征队。珠峰是我的目标，我曾经认为，只要攀登珠穆朗玛峰就足够了，但攀岩就像是一种瘾，攀登的越多，我想爬的越多，“她说。

Agence France-Presse photographer Ronaldo Schemidt won the prestigious 2018 World Press Photo of the Year Award with a fiery image of a masked Venezuelan protester which judges said symbolised a country "burning". Schemidt’s photo, taken during violent clashes with riot police and protesters demonstrating against President Nicolas Maduro’s regime in Caracas last year, invoked an instant emotion, the judges said. Schemidt was covering the demonstrations for AFP in May 2017 when the then 28-year-old Victor Salazar went up in flames as he and other protestors were trying to destroy a police motorbike and the gas tank exploded in his face. The image shows Salazar － who is wearing a mask － running as a cloak of fire envelopes his body. He survived the incident with first and second-degree burns.

For the past 15 years fans of tormented superstar Leslie Cheung, one of the first celebrities to come out as gay in Asia, have gathered at Hong Kong’s Mandarin Oriental Hotel to mourn the day he took his own life. One of Hong Kong’s most popular male singers and actors of the mid-1980s, Leslie Cheung Kwok Wing was not afraid of provoking controversy with his overt sexuality and provocative performances during a more socially conservative era. And 15 years after his death, Cheung is still attracting new fans, including teenagers and millennials. Lam, a 15-year-old who attended 1 April’s vigil, was only a few months old when Cheung died. She told BBC Chinese she had "discovered him on YouTube"."He was charismatic; especially when he went androgynous...it’s gorgeous," she said. 25-year-old Wu travelled from Hunan province on mainland China with his boyfriend to mourn the icon. Wu told BBC Chinese he drew strength from Cheung’s "spirit of being true to oneself".

A single human finger bone from at least 86,000 years ago points to Arabia as a key destination for Stone Age excursions out of Africa that allowed people to rapidly spread across Asia.Excavations at Al Wusta, a site in Saudi Arabia’s Nefud desert, produced this diminutive discovery. It’s the oldest known Homo sapiens fossil outside of Africa and the narrow strip of the Middle East that joins Africa with Asia, based on dating of the bone itself, says a team led by archaeologists Huw Groucutt and Michael Petraglia. This new find strengthens the idea that early human dispersals out of Africa began well before the traditional estimated departure time of 60,000 years ago and extended deep into Arabia, the scientists report April 9 in Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution.The 2016 Al Wusta find is probably the middle bone from an adult’s middle finger, suspects Groucutt, of the University of Oxford. It’s unclear whether the bone came from a man or a woman, or from a right or left hand.\n新聞辭典


至少8萬6000年前的一件人類手指骨骼顯示，阿拉伯半島是石器時代人類遷出非洲的重要地點，人類藉此迅速擴散至亞洲。這項微型證據產於沙烏地阿拉伯內夫得沙漠中一處遺址、位於中央區的出土文物。考古學家豪烏畢．格魯卡特和米赫依．派特利雅領導的團隊表示，根據該件骨骼的定年，它是迄今在非洲以外所發現最古老的智人化石，並指出這塊中東地區的狹長地帶，連結非洲與亞洲。科學家在4月9日刊登於《自然生態學與進化》期刊的報告中表示，這項新發現強化了以下觀點：早期人類遷出非洲的時間，早於傳統上估計的6萬年前，人類的擴散並曾深入阿拉伯半島。牛津大學的格魯卡特猜測，這件2016年在中央區的發現，可能是一名成人的中指中節指骨。但還不清楚這塊骨骼來自男性或女性，是右手或左手。


至少86,000年前的一颗人类指骨指向阿拉伯，是石器时代远离非洲的一个重要目的地，它允许人们在亚洲迅速传播。在沙乌地阿拉伯的Nefud沙漠的Al Wusta地区进行的勘探工作产生了这种小型化发现。考古学家Huw Groucutt和Michael Petraglia领导的一个研究小组说，这是迄今为止非洲以外最古老的人类化石，也是非洲与亚洲连接在一起的狭长地带。这个新发现强化了这样一个观点：早在6万年前的传统估计起飞时间之前，早期人类驱散到非洲以外的地方就开始了，并且延伸到了阿拉伯深处，科学家们在4月9日报道了自然生态学和进化论。2016年Al Wusta发现可能是来自成年中指的中骨，怀疑牛津大学的Groucutt。目前还不清楚骨头是来自男人还是女人，还是来自右手或左手。\ n新闻辞典

About 440,000 people in South Korea are estimated to be preparing to take the state-run civil service exams. The research was conducted by Kim Hyang-duck and Lee Dae-joong, who are in doctoral courses at Konkuk University and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, respectively.More than half of the test applicants counted "job security" as the primary motivation for choosing a civil servant as a job, while 48 percent said they study more than 10 hours every day for the exams. Only 2.9 percent of test applicants said they want to be a civil servant "to serve the country."

A 112-year-old Japanese man born months before Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity was recognized on Tuesday as the world’s oldest man.Masazo Nonaka, born on July 25, 1905, took the title after Francisco Nunez Olivera of Spain died this year at the aged 113, Guinness World Records said.A farmer and lumberjack in his youth, Nonaka later ran a hot spring inn in his hometown of Ashoro, on Hokkaido island, 900 km north of Tokyo, and raised two sons and three daughters.Nonaka enjoys dipping in a spa and is fond of sweets, especially a strawberry sponge cake. He was joined at an award ceremony on Tuesday by relatives and officials.The Guinness World Records title for the oldest man who ever lived is held by another Japan man, Jiroemon Kimura, who died in 2013 at the age of 116 years and 54 days.The greatest authenticated age for any human is 122 years, 164 days by Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died in 1997. （Reuters）

Everyone has that spot in their house or car where they let the mail and receipts pile up.For 68-year old Jimmie Smith, it was an old shirt hanging in his closet. Stuffed in its pockets was a stack of unchecked lottery tickets."I always told myself, ’I’ll check them when I have the time,’" the New Jersey man said.It’s a good thing he did. Because had he waited two days longer, he’d have lost out on $24.1 million.More than a year ago, Smith bought a ticket to the New York Lotto.The winning numbers for the May 25, 2016 drawing were： 05 - 12 - 13 - 22 - 25 - 35.The New York Gaming Commission knew the winning ticket, worth $24.1 million, was sold at a bodega in New York City － but it didn’t know who bought the ticket.Winners have a year to claim the prize and that expiration day was quickly approaching.So earlier in 2017, the New York Lottery started to get the word out."We urge New York Lottery players： Check your pockets. Check your glove box. Look under the couch cushions. If you have this winning ticket, we look forward to meeting you," Gweneth Dean, director of the Commission’s Division of the Lottery, said at the time.


所有人的家裡或車內，都有個專門堆放信件或收據的地方。對68歲的吉米．史密斯來說，（他堆放信件或發票的地方）是掛在衣櫥裡的一件舊襯衫。襯衫口袋裡塞了一堆沒查看是否中獎的樂透彩券。「我總是跟自己說，『等我有空就會查看是否中獎。』」來自（美國）新澤西州的史密斯說。幸好他真的去查了。因為要是他再晚2天，就會與2410萬美元的獎金擦身而過。史密斯在1年多前買了1張紐約州樂透彩券。2016年5月25日開獎的號碼是：05 - 12 - 13 - 22 - 25 - 35。紐約州博弈委員會知道，這張中了2410萬美元的彩券是在紐約市一家雜貨店售出，但不知道是誰買了這張彩券。中獎者有1年時間可以領獎，截止日已迫在眉睫。紐約州樂透當局於是在2017年初將此事公諸於世。「我們呼籲紐約州樂透玩家：查看你的口袋。查看你的車內置物箱。查看沙發靠墊的下面。你若持有這張中獎彩券，我們期待與您相會。」該博弈委員會的樂透部主任葛妮絲．狄恩當時如此說。 


每个人都在他们的房子或汽车的那个地方放置邮件和收据。对于68岁的吉米史密斯来说，这是一件挂在衣柜里的旧衬衫。 “我总是告诉自己，&amp;amp;#39;我会在有空的时候检查他们，&amp;amp;#39;”新泽西州男子说，“这是他做的一件好事。因为如果他再等两天，他就会损失2410万美元。一年多以前，史密斯买了一张纽约乐透券。2016年5月25日的彩票中奖号码是：05  -  12  - 13  -  22  -  25  -  35。纽约博彩委员会知道这张价值2410万美元的获奖彩票在纽约市的一家酒吧售出 - 但它不知道是谁买的。门票有一年要求奖金和到期日即将到来，所以2017年早些时候，纽约彩民开始说出这样的话：“我们敦促纽约彩票球员：检查你的口袋，检查你的手套箱，看看沙发垫下。有这张获奖彩票，我们期待着与您会面，“彩票委员会彩票部门主管格温妮丝迪恩当时表示。

Russians are drinking less than at any point since the fall of the Soviet Union, figures show, as a raft of government measures bear fruit and healthy living becomes ever more fashionable.Vodka might still serve as a national symbol but last year Russians drank less alcohol per capita than the French or Germans, according to World Health Organization report that factored in consumption of bootleg booze.And tobacco use also plummeted by more than a fifth between 2009 and 2016, down to 30 percent of Russians smoking.WHO’s representative in Russia Melita Vujnovic points the achievement to legislation introduced over the last 13 years to combat a public health crisis and boost life expectancy, including a ban on shops selling any alcohol after 11 pm and increases in the minimum retail price of spirits.Also, a general trend towards healthy living was also behind the cut back in smoking and drinking, especially in larger cities. "Now there’s this focus on wellness, which becomes more fashionable than it was before," said an official.


數據顯示，由於一系列政策奏效，以及健康生活的理念比以往盛行，俄羅斯人的飲酒量創下蘇聯垮台以來新低。世界衛生組織（WHO）一份計入私釀酒攝取量的報告指出，伏特加仍是俄國的國家象徵，但俄人去年人均飲酒量已低於法國及德國人。同時，菸草用量在2009至2016年間，也遽降逾5分之1，僅剩30％俄國人會抽菸。WHO的俄國代表梅莉塔．芙伊諾維奇，將此成果歸功於過去13年來為解決大眾健康危機，以及提高預期壽命而實施的法案，包括商店晚間11點後禁止售酒，以及調高酒類最低零售價格。健康生活風氣興起，也是菸酒攝取量大減的原因，在大城市尤其普遍。一名官員指出：「現在人們關注健康，這個觀念比以前更加流行。」


数字显示，自苏联解体以来，俄罗斯人的饮酒量比任何时候都少，因为一系列的政府措施结果果实，健康的生活变得更加时髦。伏特加仍然可以作为国家的象征，但去年俄罗斯人少喝酒根据世界卫生组织的报告，这个数字被认为是消费盗窃酒。在2009年和2016年之间，烟草使用量也暴跌了五分之一以上，下降到俄罗斯人吸烟的30％。世界卫生组织的代表在俄罗斯Melita Vujnovic将这一成就归功于过去13年推出的立法，以打击公共健康危机并提高预期寿命，其中包括禁止晚上11点以后出售任何酒类的商店，以及烈酒的最低零售价上涨。此外，健康生活也是减少吸烟和饮酒的后盾，特别是在大城市。一位官员说：“现在，人们对健康的关注比以前更加时髦。

Japanese police have arrested a 73-year-old man suspected of keeping his son in a wooden cage for over 20 years.Yoshitane Yamasaki said he locked up his son, now 42, because he suffered mental problems and was sometimes violent, according to officials quoted by public broadcaster NHK.The cage, 1m in height and less than 2m wide, was in a hut next to Yamasaki’s house in the city of Sanda. The son, who now suffers a bent back, is being looked after by authorities.Local media report he has been in the care of a social welfare facility in western Japan since January. A visit by a city official to Yamasaki’s home at the time alerted authorities to the 42-year-old man’s confinement.Investigators believe Yamasaki began confining his mentally ill son from the age of 16, when he began to "act up". For the time being, police have only arrested the pensioner for caging his son for 36 hours on 18 January. Yamasaki has reportedly admitted the allegations, telling authorities that he fed his son every day, and allowed him to bathe every other day. 


日本警方逮捕一名涉嫌將兒子關在木籠裡逾20年的73歲男子。山崎喜胤說，他將現年42歲的兒子關起來，因為他罹患精神疾病，時而狂暴，日本公共電視台「日本放送協會」引述官員說法報導。這個1公尺高、不到2公尺寬的籠子，放在（兵庫縣）三田市山崎住家旁的小屋裡。現已駝背的兒子正由當局照顧。當地媒體報導，受害者自1月以來已由日本西部一個社會福利機構照料。當時，一名市府官員前往山崎住處家訪，才使當局警覺到該名42歲男子遭監禁。調查人員認定，山崎從兒子16歲開始「發作」時，就囚禁罹患精神疾病的他。目前，警方僅以1月18日將兒子關籠達36小時為由，逮捕該名退休老人。據聞山崎承認前述指控，他告訴當局，他每天餵食兒子，每隔一天讓他洗澡。


日本警方逮捕了一名73岁的男子，怀疑他的儿子被关在一个木制笼子里已有20多年了。据官员介绍，Yoshitane Yamasaki说他锁定了他的儿子，现在42岁，因为他患有精神问题，有时甚至是暴力的。由公共广播公司NHK引用。笼子高1米，宽不到2米，位于山城市山崎家的旁边一间小屋里。现在遭受挫折的儿子正受到当局的照顾。当地媒体报道，自1月份以来，他一直在日本西部的社会福利机构照顾。当时一名市政官员到山崎家访问时警告当局对这名四十二岁男子的监禁。调查人员认为，山崎从16岁开始限制他的精神病儿子，他开始“行动起来”。目前，警方只在1月18日逮捕了领养儿童36个小时的养老金领取者。据报道，山崎曾承认这些指控，告诉当局他每天都给他的儿子喂食，并允许他每隔一天洗澡一次。

A Beijing hospital has demanded loyalty to the Communist Party from all potential sperm donors but it is not clear how the hospital plans to verify the ideological loyalty of donors.Peking University Third Hospital said in a statement on its WeChat web page on Wednesday that donors must "love the socialist motherland and embrace the leadership of the Communist Party. He must be loyal to the party’s tasks, be decent, law-abiding and be free of any political problems”.The statement said all applicants must be men aged between 20 and 45 and that they must not have any genetic or infectious diseases, or show any signs of weight problems, color blindness or hair loss. The men must also have "favorable political qualities".The campaign has drawn mockery from Chinese social media users, with one WeChat post reading： "Love for the party starts with a sperm." Another message, on Weibo, pointed out： "Acquired traits can’t be passed down."

An unknown killer preying on pigs in China has been identified as a new kind of coronavirus. And like the deadly SARS virus, this one also got its start in bats.In late 2016, pigs mysteriously started having intense diarrhea and vomiting on farms in China’s southeastern Guangdong province. By May 2017, the disease had killed 24,693 piglets. By analyzing samples from sick piglets, researchers pieced together the genetic blueprint of the virus causing swine acute diarrhea syndrome, or SADS. It shares 95 percent of its genetic code with another coronavirus, HKU2, detected in cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in 2016. Evidence suggests these two coronaviruses share a common ancestor and that SADS jumped from bats to pigs, researchers report April 4 in Nature. No farm workers tested positive for SADS, so the disease doesn’t appear to infect humans. 


掠捕中國豬隻的無名殺手已被證實為一種新型冠狀病毒。它與致命的嚴重急性呼吸道症候群（SARS）病毒相同，也源自蝙蝠。2016年末，中國東南部廣東省農家的豬隻，開始出現原因成謎的劇烈腹瀉與嘔吐。截至2017年5月，這種疾病已造成2萬4693頭豬仔死亡。透過分析罹病豬仔的檢驗樣本，科學家拼湊出這種引發豬急性腹瀉症候群（SADS）的病毒基因藍圖。其遺傳密碼與另一種冠狀病毒HKU2的一致性高達95%，HKU2是2016年在穴居蹄鼻蝙蝠身上檢測出的病毒。證據顯示，這兩種冠狀病毒同源，且SADS病毒是從蝙蝠跨種傳播到豬隻，研究報告4月4日刊於科學期刊《自然》。由於沒有農家被檢測出SADS陽性反應，該疾病似乎不會感染人類。


在中国，一头不知名的杀人凶手已被确认为一种新型的冠状病毒。而且就像致命的SARS病毒一样，这一病毒也从蝙蝠开始。2016年底，猪在中国广东东南部的农场神秘地开始腹泻和呕吐。到2017年5月，该病造成24693头仔猪死亡。通过分析患病仔猪的样本，研究人员将引起猪急性腹泻综合症（SADS）的病毒的基因蓝图拼凑在一起。研究人员在4月4日的“自然”杂志上报道说，它与95％的冠状病毒HKU2共享95％的遗传密码，证据表明这两种冠状病毒共有一个共同的祖先，SADS从蝙蝠跳到猪。没有农场工人对SADS检测呈阳性，因此这种疾病似乎不会感染人类。

The majority of South Korea’s recyclables are exported to China. Beijing’s recent decision to ban solid waste imports is causing a ripple effect on the recycling programs in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province area.The ban on imports of 24 types of recyclables － a reflection of China’s tougher stance on pollution － mostly impacts local recyclers that used to sell waste to China. Some of the 48 for-profit garbage service companies operating in three metropolitan cities, including Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon said last week that they will halt collecting recyclables banned by China starting April 1, citing low margins and increasing processing cost. 


南韓大多數的可回收物出口至中國，北京近來禁止進口固體廢料的決定，對首爾和京畿道地區資源回收計畫造成的效應正逐漸擴散。


韩国的大部分可回收物品都出口到中国。北京最近决定禁止进口固体废物，这对首尔和京畿道地区的回收计划造成了连锁反应。禁止进口24种可回收物品 - 这反映了中国在污染方面更加强硬的立场 - 主要影响当地回收商过去的习惯把废物卖给中国。在首尔，京畿道和仁川等三个大都市城市运营的48家营利性垃圾服务公司中，有部分表示，自4月1日起禁止收集中国禁止使用的可回收物品，理由是利润率低，加工成本增加。

Alain Robert, sometimes known as the "French Spiderman" for climbing skyscrapers worldwide, is still defying gravity at the age of 55.He scaled the summit of the fourth-tallest building in Paris’ modern business district on Wednesday after evading security officers who had thwarted an earlier attempt.A hobby that started at 11 years old has taken Robert to more than 150 skyscrapers around the world, including Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, the Eiffel Tower, and the Sydney Opera House."For me, climbing is a passion, it’s a way of life," he said.It took Robert just over an hour to scale to the top of the 187-metre high Tour Total.He has accomplished the feat twice in the past.He often climbs without permission and has been arrested several times. In 2008, he scaled the New York Times building to unfurl a banner on global warming, and was arrested by police.Robert sees no end in sight for his vertiginous adventures."As long as I have the physical strength to scale heights, I will continue to climb,"he said. （Reuters） 


因在全球各地攀爬摩天大樓時而被稱為「法國蜘蛛人」的艾倫．羅伯特（法語發音為阿郎．侯貝赫），55歲仍在和重力對抗。閃躲稍早阻撓他意圖的保全人員後，他週三登上巴黎現代化的商業區第四高樓樓頂。11歲萌發出的這項嗜好，已把羅伯特帶向全球超過150座摩天大樓，包括杜拜的全球最高樓哈里發塔、艾菲爾鐵塔以及雪梨歌劇院。他說：「對我而言，攀登是種愛戀，它是一種生活方式。」羅伯特只花一個多小時的時間，就登上187公尺高的「道達爾塔」。他過去達成這項豐功偉業兩次。他時常在未獲准的情況下攀爬，已被逮捕多次。2008年，他登上《紐約時報》大樓展開一個關於全球暖化的橫幅，並遭警方逮捕。對於他令人眼花撩亂的冒險行為，羅伯特還沒打算劃下句點。他說：「只要我有體力登高，我將會繼續爬。」（路透）


阿兰罗伯特有时被称为“法国蜘蛛侠”，因为他在世界范围内攀登摩天大楼，但他仍然在55岁时不畏重力。周三，他在巴黎现代商业区的第四高楼大楼的顶峰上逃脱，挫败了早先的尝试。一个从11岁开始的嗜好让罗伯特去世界各地的150多座摩天大楼，包括迪拜的世界最高建筑迪拜塔，艾菲尔铁塔和悉尼歌剧院。“对我而言，攀登是一种激情，这是一种生活方式，“他说。这让罗伯特花了一个多小时才爬上187米高的Tour Total的顶部。他过去曾两次完成这项壮举。他经常擅自攀登并已多次被捕。 2008年，他缩小了纽约时报的大楼，打开了全球变暖的旗帜，并被警方逮捕。罗伯特因为他的冒险活动而看不到终点。“只要我有体力来攀登高空，我就会继续攀登，“他说。 （路透社）

An underwater robot has snapped photographs of a pottery urn probably dating from the seventh or eighth century that has been left almost intact at the bottom of Lake Biwako.It is believed to be a reddish brown Haji pottery urn made sometime between the Asuka Period （592-710） and Nara Period （710-784）.The urn was found in an underwater archaeological site called the Tsuzuraozaki Kotei Iseki.Since 1924, many pottery pieces, mainly from between the Jomon Pottery Culture Period （c. 8000 B.C.-300 B.C.） and Heian Period （794-1185）, have been found at the site at a depth between 10 and 70 meters, often caught in fishing nets.It remains a mystery why so much pottery from such a wide time span have been found at this site.Some speculate a settlement was submerged by a rise in the water level or the pots were sunk there in obscure rituals. Others sidestep romance and suggest it was just a dumping ground for used ceramics.


一具水下機器人在（日本）琵琶湖底拍攝到1個年代可能介於7世紀或8世紀、外型幾乎完好無缺的陶甕的照片。此甕據信是在飛鳥時代（西元592年到710年）與奈良時代（西元710年到784年）間的某個時期所打造的紅棕色的「土師器」。此甕被發現的地點，是一個名叫「葛籠尾崎湖底遺跡」的水下考古遺址。自1924年起，這個水深從10到70公尺的遺址，就常有許多年代主要介於繩文陶器文化時代（約西元前8000年到西元前300年）與平安時代（西元794年到1185年）之間的陶器碎片勾住漁網而被發現。該處為何會有這麼多年代跨幅甚大的陶器出土，迄今仍是個謎。有人猜測此處過去可能曾有聚落，稍後因水面上升而被淹沒，或者這些陶器因某不明儀式而被沉入此處。另有人的看法不這麼浪漫，覺得此處不過就是舊陶器的垃圾場。


一台水下机器人拍下了可能可追溯到公元七世纪或八世纪的陶器瓮的照片，这些照片几乎完好无损地留在了琵琶湖底部。它被认为是在飞鸟时代（592年）之前制作的红棕色哈吉陶器瓮这个瓮是在一个名为Tsuzuraozaki Kotei Iseki的水下考古遗址中发现的。自1924年以来，许多陶器碎片，主要来自绳纹陶器文化时期（c。711）和奈良时期（710-784）。公元前8000年 - 公元前300年）和平安时期（794-1185年），在现场发现的深度在10到70米之间，经常被渔网捕获。从如此广泛的时间跨度来看，这么多陶器仍然是一个谜。已被发现在这个网站。有人推测一个解决方案被淹没的水位上升或盆沉没在那里模糊的仪式。其他人则回避浪漫，并表示这只是废旧陶瓷的倾销地。

In Bangkok, the Thai capital, Wireless Road, like many streets, is festooned with electrical and telecom cables, a black web that hangs menacingly overhead. But Bangkok authorities are now untangling the cables and moving them underground as part of an urban renewal.Wireless Road, which got its name from hosting one of Thailand’s first radio transmitting stations, is among dozens of streets targeted in the early phase of the de-cluttering campaign.The project has been planned for years, but had an unexpected progress after Microsoft founder Bill Gates visited Bangkok in 2016 and took a disapproving photo of one street’s wiry web. Less than a week later, the government announced that cleanup was moving forward.So far 1,184 utility poles have been removed from three of the city’s biggest roads. Over the next five years authorities plan to strip cables from 39 more streets totaling 127 kilometers."The main advantage is the security of the electrical system. When the cables are underground, the problem with disturbances that can cause blackouts will be gone," said Bangkok authorities.


在泰國首都曼谷，無線路就像許多街道一樣，隨處可見電線和電纜，高掛在頭頂上方，形成帶來壓迫感的黑網。曼谷當局正在整頓這些電纜線，將其移設地下，作為都市更新的一環。無線路名稱的由來，是因為泰國首家無線廣播站設立於此，這條路也是整頓計畫最早鎖定的街道之一。這項計畫研擬多年，卻是在微軟創辦人比爾．蓋茲2016年造訪曼谷，由於不認同而拍了一張街道電線的照片後，才出現預期之外的進展。不到一週後，政府就宣布展開整頓計畫。迄今，曼谷市區的3條大馬路，已移除1184座電線桿。當局計畫5年內移除逾39條街道的電纜線，總長度達到127公里。曼谷當局說：「主要好處是確保電力系統的安全性。電纜線地下化後，造成停電的線路干擾問題就消失了。」


在曼谷，泰国首都无线路与许多街道一样，挂着电气和电信电缆，一个黑色的网络悬挂在天花板上。但是，曼谷当局现在正在拆除电缆，并将其作为城市重建的一部分，将其转移到地下。无线电路以其主办泰国第一个无线电发射站之一的名字而闻名于数十条街道，这项计划已经计划好几年了，但是在微软创始人比尔盖茨在2016年访问曼谷之后取得了意想不到的进展，并且拍摄了一条街道网络的反面照片。不到一个星期之后，政府宣布清理工作正在进行中。迄今为止，该市迄今为止最大的三条道路共有1184座电线杆已被拆除。在接下来的五年里，有关部门计划从另外39条街道总长127公里剥离电缆，“主要优势在于电气系统的安全性，当电缆处于地下时，可能导致停电的扰动问题将消失。”曼谷当局。

Researchers in Japan have fitted a train with a speaker that barks like a dog and snorts like a deer in order to prevent collisions on the railway.Asahi Shimbun newspaper reports that the combination of sounds is designed to scare deer away from the tracks in a bid to reduce the number of animal deaths on the railway.Officials from the Railway Technical Research Institute （RTRI）say that a three-second blast of the sound of a deer snorting attracts the animals’ attention, and 20 seconds of dog barking is enough to make them take flight. Deer are attracted to railway lines because of a need for iron in their diets. They lick the rails to pick up iron filings caused by the action of wheels against tracks.This dietary need has led to a battle to keep the deer separate from the railway, and previous plans which involved the spraying of lion faeces on the track were abandoned after rain washed away the dung almost immediately.Another plan, which earned a railway employee Japan’s Good Design Award in December, is for deer crossings policed by ultrasonic waves, which allow animals access to the tracks at times when trains aren’t running. 


日本研究人員在一列列車上裝置像狗吠叫、像鹿噴鼻息的擴音器，以防止鐵道上的撞擊事件。「朝日新聞」報導，相關聲音的結合是設計來嚇跑鐵軌上的鹿，以降低鐵道的鹿隻死亡數。鐵道綜合技術研究所（RTRI）官員說，3秒的鹿鼻息聲可吸引該動物注意，而為時20秒的狗吠聲足以讓牠們逃之夭夭。鹿被吸引到鐵路沿線，係因牠們需要攝取鐵。牠們舔鐵軌以獲取輪子與軌道摩擦產生的鐵屑。這種攝食需求導致一場讓鹿離開鐵道的奮戰，而此前將獅糞噴灑鐵軌的計畫，在雨水幾乎立即沖走糞便後被放棄。另一個讓一名鐵道從業人員在去年12月贏得日本優良設計獎的計畫，是以超音波監控鹿穿越鐵路，這讓該動物在列車沒有通過之際仍可不時來到鐵軌旁。


日本的研究人员已经安装了一种带有扬声器的火车，像狗一样吠叫，像鹿一样哼唱，以防止在铁路上发生碰撞。朝日新闻报道称，声音的结合旨在将鹿从竞标中吓跑以减少铁路上的动物死亡人数。铁路技术研究所（RTRI）的官员说，三秒钟的鹿打鼾声响吸引了动物的注意力，并且20秒钟的狗吠足以让他们坐飞机。由于铁需要铁，鹿被铁路线所吸引。他们舔铁轨拾起轮胎对轨道行动造成的铁屑。这种饮食需求导致了鹿与铁路分离的战斗，并且涉及将狮子粪喷洒在轨道上的先前计划被放弃雨后几乎立即冲走了粪便。另一项计划于12月赢得了日本优秀设计奖的铁路员工，用于超音波监管的鹿过境点，当火车未运行时，允许动物进入轨道。

A Pakistani news channel has hired the country’s first transgender TV newsreader. She anchored her first show on Friday, after three months of training.Marvia Malik, 21, made her debut appearance on the Kohenoor TV news channel. Ms Malik, a journalism graduate who has also worked as a model, told the BBC she was moved to tears when she was offered the job.She hoped her work would help improve the lives of Pakistan’s transgender community. "Our community should be treated equally and there must not be any gender discrimination. We should be given equal rights and be considered ordinary citizens, instead of third-gender," she said.Transgender people face severe discrimination in Pakistan and many struggle to find jobs. Some are forced into begging, dancing or prostitution to earn money. Many transgender people, intersex people and eunuchs have been attacked, murdered, and raped in the country, as well as other South Asian nations such as India and Bangladesh.

When people watch live music together, their brains waves synchronize, and this brain bonding is linked with having a better time. The new findings, reported March 27 at a Cognitive Neuroscience Society meeting, are a reminder that humans are social creatures. Study participants were split into groups of 20 and experienced music in one of three ways. Some watched a live concert with a large audience, some watched a recording of the concert with a large audience, and some watched the recording with only a few other people. Each person wore EEG caps, headwear covered with electrodes that measure the collective behavior of the brain’s nerve cells. The musicians played an original song they wrote for the study.The delta brain waves of audience members who watched the music live were more synchronized than those of people in the other two groups. Delta brain waves fall in a frequency range that roughly corresponds to the beat of the music, suggesting that beat drives the synchronicity, said neuroscientist Molly Henry of Western University in London, Canada. The more synchronized a particular audience member was with others, the more he or she reported feeling connected to the performers and enjoying the show.


人們一起觀賞現場音樂會時，腦波會同步，而這種大腦聯繫也關係到觀眾能否度過歡樂時光。3月27日在「認知神經科學學會」大會上提出的這項新發現，點出「人類是社會性動物」的本質。研究參與者以20人為一組，透過3種不同方式體驗音樂會。有些和一大群人一起觀賞現場音樂會，有些和一大群人一起觀賞預錄音樂會，有些則只和幾個人一起觀看錄影帶。每位受試者都會配戴腦波帽，那是一種被電極覆蓋的帽子，可監測及蒐集腦神經元的集體行為。音樂家演奏的則是他們為該實驗創作的一首原創歌曲。觀賞現場音樂會的觀眾，德爾塔腦波（δ波）比其他2組受試者更為同步。加拿大倫敦市西安大略大學神經科學家莫莉．亨立表示，德爾塔腦波進入同步的頻率範圍，大致符合音樂的節拍，顯示節拍可驅動腦波同步性。而觀眾和其他人的腦波同步性愈高，他或她愈能感覺與表演者心有靈犀、享受這場表演。


当人们一起观看现场音乐时，他们的大脑波会同步，而这种大脑联系与更好的时间联系在一起。 3月27日在认知神经科学学会会议上报告的新发现提醒人类是社会生物。研究参与者以三种方式之一分成20人组和经验丰富的音乐。有些人观看了一场有大量观众的现场音乐会，有些人观看了一场大型观众的音乐会录音，有些人只观看了其他几个人的录音。每个人都戴着脑电图帽，帽子上覆盖着测量大脑神经细胞集体行为的电极。音乐家演奏了他们为这项研究所写的原创歌曲。观看现场音乐的观众成员的三角洲脑波比其他两组人更加同步。加拿大伦敦西部大学的神经科学家莫莉亨利说，三角洲脑波的频率范围大致与音乐的节拍相对应，这表明节拍驱动了同步性。特定观众与其他观众成员的同步程度越高，他或她所报告的感受就越多，他们感觉与表演者有联系，并且欣赏了节目。

The only pine tree that survived the 2011 tsunami on a beach in Minami-soma, Fukushima Prefecture and became a symbol of resilience was cut down on Dec. 27.A ceremony was held on the beach in the city’s Kashima district to bid farewell to "the lone pine of Kashima.""We received great strength and moral support from you" Kazuo Goga, 77, leader of a volunteer group that worked to preserve the tree, said in a speech at the ceremony.The tree was one of tens of thousands planted along the beach for 3 kilometers north to south as a windbreak forest.However, the Great East Japan Earthquake spawned a tsunami that washed away many of the trees on March 11, 2011. Other trees later died after being submerged in seawater for a prolonged period.The sole survivor itself was visibly growing weaker.

"Teaching young people to dream again" is the vision of a Moroccan cultural center in a rundown Casablanca district, once home to suicide bombers.Based in a white building next to a tramline and opposite a mosque, the Stars Cultural Center in Sidi Moumen regularly hosts more than 300 young people for classes in music, classical dance, hip-hop, English and French."When we tell young people violence is not a means to express themselves, we must find them other means," said filmmaker and co-founder of the center Nabil Ayouch. "Even in an area without rights, there is the right to hope."Students’ families pay for the lessons but those on limited means receive subsidized rates. The center offers free film, hosts foreign artists and gives shows that attract spectators from far and wide."In Morocco’s conservative society, the relationship with art, dance in particular, is very difficult. But today, parents come to see the shows, they are proud of their children," said the center’s assistant manager, Soumia Errahmani.


在曾是自殺炸彈客據點的摩洛哥卡薩布蘭卡市一個破敗地區，「教導年輕人再次編織夢想」是一所文化中心的目標。位於西迪摩曼區的「繁星文化中心」，落腳於一棟白色建築物內，隔鄰是電車軌道，對面是一座清真寺。那裡開設音樂、古典舞蹈、嘻哈、英語和法語等課程，定期接收逾300名年輕學子。中心共同創辦人、電影導演納比爾．艾尤奇說：「當我們告訴年輕人，暴力不是表達自我的方法時，我們必須為他們找到其他方法。即使在一個沒有權利的地方，也有權利懷抱希望。」家長付費讓孩子上課，經濟能力有限者可享折扣。中心免費播放電影，也會邀請外國藝術家來訪，舉辦的表演更吸引各地觀眾前來。中心副理索米亞．艾拉曼妮說：「在摩洛哥的傳統社會，與藝術接觸非常困難，尤其是舞蹈。但如今，父母會來看表演，也能對自己的孩子感到自豪。」

A German village has decided to keep a contentious Nazi-era church bell that bears a swastika and the words "All for the Fatherland — Adolf Hitler," arguing it serves as a reminder of the country’s dark past.The parish council of Herxheim voted 10-3 that the bronze bell from 1934 should remain as "an impetus for reconciliation and a memorial against violence and injustice." The council rejected an offer by the regional Protestant Church to pay for taking down the 240 kilogram bell and replacing it.A memorial pointing to the bell’s history will now be fixed on the heritage-listed church, the Jakobskirche.The village of just 700 people has repeatedly caught national attention for the controversial "Hitler bell" since a former church organist complained about the inscription. Some church-goers were dismayed to find out that they had got married, baptized their children or joined other religious ceremonies and events under the Hitler bell.


一個德國小鎮決定保留一口引發爭議的納粹時期教堂大鐘，該鐘鐫刻有納粹標誌，以及「一切為祖國—阿道夫．希特勒」字樣。該鎮主張，這口鐘可作為國家黑暗過去的提醒。黑爾克斯海姆鎮議會以10比3票，決定這口1934年的銅鐘應保留作為「促進和解以及反暴力與不公義的紀念物」。該區基督新教教會願意支付取下並代換這口240公斤銅鐘的費用，但遭鎮議會拒絕。一塊銅鐘歷史的紀念指示牌，如今將設置在這座被列入文物保護的教會「雅各堂」中。

The government in South Korea’s capital Seoul is introducing a new initiative to force its employees to leave work on time - by powering down all their computers at 20：00 on Fridays. It says it is trying to stop a "culture of working overtime."The shutdown initiative is set to roll out across three phases over the next three months. The programme will begin on 30 March, with all computers switched off by 20：00. The second phase starts in April, with employees having their computers turned off by 19：30 on the second and fourth Friday that month.From May on, the programme will be in full-swing, with computers shut off by 19：00 every Friday. All employees will be subjected to the shutdown, though exemptions may be provided in special circumstances.South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world. Government employees there work an average of 2,739 hours a year - about 1,000 hours more than workers in other developed countries. Earlier this month, South Korea’s national assembly passed a law to cut down the maximum weekly working hours to 52, down from 68.

Former Stanford president John Hennessy and UC Berkeley professor emeritus Dave Patterson won the $1 million 2017 Alan Turing Award on Wednesday for their breakthrough work in designing energy-efficient chips in the 1980s that set the stage for smartphones’ omnipresence today.They won the Turing Award for their separate projects at Stanford and Berkeley in the early 1980s that pioneered a new microprocessor design called reduced instruction set computer (RISC), coined by Patterson and his Berkeley team.RISC’s architecture allowed the chip to use a small, highly optimized set of instructions, saving energy and time while outperforming its competition. Today, nearly 99 percent of the 16 billion microprocessors produced every year are RISC processors, and they are found in nearly all smartphones, tablets and other smart devices, according to the ACM.

In the dog-eat-dog world of U.S. politics, a 3-year-old wire-haired Vizsla in Kansas was scratching his head, after being denied a chance to run for governor, his owner said on Tuesday.The Kansas man, who registered his dog named Angus for governor, said the secretary of state’s office has halted the campaign to put his pooch in politics."His platform was going to be free Chuckit balls for life," said Terran Woolley, of Hutchinson."He is a little heartbroken and a little relieved because he doesn’t have to go to all those pointless debates," Woolley said by telephone.Woolley said he registered Angus after reading news reports that teenagers had filed candidacy paperwork and there were almost no requirements on who could run.But there is at least one."A dog cannot run for governor,"Kansas Secretary of State spokeswoman Samantha Poetter said in a statement."Kansas statute and the Kansas Constitution make repeated references to a person being governor."（Reuters）

A New Jersey man who spent decades preparing his home for doomsday is donating all of his stored food to families affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.Joseph Badame lost his wife and was in the process of losing his Medford home when the 74-year-old met a couple raising money for their family affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.Badame made a $100 donation, and then led the couple to the room where he stored all of his food and told them to take it all."I just can’t put into words just how much food there was," Victoria Martinez-Barber, 30, told the Washington Post . "It was enough to feed a town."Badame had gathered 80 barrels of food that each could sustain 84 people for four months. He said the food, which included dried beans, rice, flour, sugar, pancake mixes and more, would have been thrown away otherwise. （AP）

In Tunisian high schools, girls are required to wear uniform, while boys are allowed to wear what they like. Now, the girls are up in arms.One morning, instead of turning up for class wearing the regulation navy blue uniform, a defiant group of adolescent girls came to school in white T-shirts instead, demanding an "end to discrimination."At the elite Bizerte public school in the north, as is the case in most high schools in the North African country, pupils have to sign a school rule stipulating that wearing a uniform applies to girls only.One day in last September, supervisors reminded senior female students who did not abide by this rule that if they did not wear uniform, they would be sent home.This "injustice" inspired many of the girls to take to social networks and vent their feelings. The girls agreed to take collective action from the following day. Several boys did the same, in solidarity with their classmates.


在突尼西亞的高中，女學生被要求穿著制服，男學生卻可以穿自己想穿的衣服。現在，女學生展開絕地大反攻。某天早上，一群意圖反抗的女中學生，未穿著規定的海軍藍制服到校，反而穿上白色T恤，要求「終止歧視」。這所位於北部比塞塔市的公立菁英學校，就像這個北非國家的多數高中一樣，學生都要簽署一條僅規範女生的制服校規。去年9月某天，校方提醒未遵守規定的女學生，倘若她們不穿制服，就會被送回家。這種「不公義」促使許多女學生透過社群網站發洩情緒。她們同意隔天開始採取共同行動。若干男學生也做出相同舉動，力挺同學。


在突尼斯的高中，女孩必须穿制服，而男孩则可以穿他们喜欢的衣服。现在，这些女孩们都站起来了。一天早上，一群反抗的青少年女孩反而穿着白色T恤上学，而不是上课穿海军蓝制服，而是要求“终止歧视”。北部的精英比塞大公立学校与北非国家大多数高中的情况一样，学生必须签署学校规定，规定穿制服只适用于女生。去年9月的一天，主管提醒高级女性不遵守这条规则的学生，如果他们不穿制服，他们会被送回家。这种“不公正”激发了许多女孩到社交网络和发泄感情。女孩们同意在第二天采取集体行动。几个男孩也一样，声援同学。

Nearly 800 doctors and medical residents in the Canadian province of Quebec have signed a letter protesting against plans to raise their pay, arguing that the funds would be better spent on other areas of the province’s beleaguered healthcare system."We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be cancelled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of healthcare workers.’’It was drafted late last month by Médecins québécois pour le régime public, a group of doctors and medical students who support public healthcare.The letter says recent pay raises negotiated by their professional associations as "shocking", given the "draconian cuts" that have left nurses, orderlies and others overworked and underpaid, as well as led to a widespread lack of services for patients.The Quebec government recently announced increases of 1.4% and around 1.8% for specialists and general practitioners respectively, while recent data suggests that the average specialist in Quebec makes C$403,500 annually, while family physicians make C$255,000.


加拿大魁北克省近800名醫師與住院醫師，連署一份抗議計畫為其加薪的函文，主張錢花在該省困窘的醫療系統會更好。「我們，魁北克的醫師，要求取消給予醫師的加薪，並更恰當地分配該體系資源，以裨益醫療工作人員。」這份函文是由支持公共醫療的醫師與醫學生組成的「魁北克公立醫院醫生組織」，於上個月下旬所擬定的。函文表示，鑑於護理人員、勤務員以及其他過勞低薪的工作人員承受的「嚴酷的（經費）削減」，與所導致對病患的普遍服務不足，他們的專業公會近期協商達成的加薪「令人感到震驚」。魁北克政府最近宣布，專科醫師與一般科醫師分別加薪1.4%與約1.8%，而近期資料顯示，魁北克專科醫師平均年收入為40萬3500加幣，家醫科醫師則為25萬5000加幣。


加拿大魁北克省近800名医生和医疗居民签署了一份抗议计划提高工资的信函，认为这笔资金最好花在该省陷入困境的医疗保健系统的其他地区。“我们魁北克医生正在问提供给医生的薪水增长将被取消，并且系统的资源将更好地分配给医疗保健工作者。&amp;amp;#39;&amp;amp;#39;它是上个月底由医生和医学院医生组成的非政府组织医疗人员起草的，他们是支持公共医疗保健。信中说，由于“严厉削减”导致护士，医务人员和其他人过度劳累和低报酬，以及导致患者普遍缺乏服务，他们的专业协会最近提出的薪酬“令人震惊” 。最近的数据显示，魁北克省政府最近分别宣布专家和全科医生分别增长1.4％和1.8％魁北克省的普通专科医生每年需要403,500加元，而家庭医生则需要255,000加元。

Despite cold weather and long, dark winters, Finland has overtaken Norway to become the happiest nation on earth, according to a UN report.Finland topped a list of 156 countries ranked in the World Happiness Report on factors such as life expectancy, social support and corruption. It emerged as the happiest place even though its relatively little sun and low temperatures are often blamed for high rates of depression.Finland vaulted to the top from fifth place in last year’s report, nudging Norway down into second. The top four places are taken by Nordic nations. Denmark was placed third this year and Iceland fourth. All the Nordic countries scored highly on income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom and trust. The study found that the 10 happiest countries also scored highest on immigrant happiness, suggesting that migrants’ wellbeing was tied to the quality of life in their adopted home. With a population of around 5.5 million people, Finland counted some 300,000 foreigners in 2016.


聯合國一份報告指出，芬蘭已超越挪威，成為地球上最快樂的國家，儘管該國天候嚴寒，冬天漫長黑暗。芬蘭在「世界快樂報告」中的156國名單中居冠，該報告聚焦平均壽命、社會支持及貪腐等因素。芬蘭成為最快樂之地，即使其日照相對短少且低溫，經常被指為高憂鬱率之因。芬蘭從去年報告中的第五名躍居為榜首，將挪威推到第二名。前4名均為北歐國家拿下。丹麥今年名列第三，冰島第四。所有北歐國家在所得、健康平均壽命、社會支持、自由及信任等指標上都獲得高分。研究發現，最快樂的10個國家，也在移民快樂指標上獲得最高分，顯示移民的福祉與他們移居之地的生活品質有關。芬蘭人口約550萬，2016年估算約有30萬外國人。


根据联合国的一份报告，尽管天气寒冷，漫长而黑暗的冬季，芬兰已经超过挪威成为地球上最幸福的国家。芬兰在世界幸福报告中排名156个国家，其中包括人均寿命，社会支持和腐败。尽管其相对较少的阳光和低温经常被归咎于高比率的抑郁症，但它仍然是最快乐的地方。芬兰在去年的报告中排名第五，挪威排名第二。前四名的地方是北欧国家采取的。丹麦今年排名第三，冰岛排名第四。所有的北欧国家在收入，健康的预期寿命，社会支持，自由和信任方面得分都很高。研究发现，这10个最幸福的国家在移民幸福方面得分最高，这表明移民的福利与他们收养的家庭的生活质量息息相关。芬兰拥有约550万人口，2016年有约30万外国人。

The term dark pool relates to the financial sector. Look at it as a private forum for traders and investors to exchange securities or digital assets. Buyers and sellers agree to conduct trades at specific prices, yet none of this activity will be made visible on the public order book of said exchange.Big players, also known as "whales", will often converge on these dark pools to buy or sell large amounts of cryptocurrency. Using a dark pool ensures all transactions are confidential, as no one knows who is trading with whom. To some people, this is very important, whereas the average bitcoin enthusiasts will be far less concerned about making their intentions clear to the rest of the world.Kraken launched this offering in 2016. It seems evident there is a demand for this type of trading platform, as investors want to buy and sell large amounts of cryptocurrency without causing a bubble or mass panic.


「黑池」一詞與金融界有關。可將其視為投資者與交易者交換證券或數位資產的秘密論壇。買家和賣家同意以特定價格進行交易，但相關交易活動卻不會顯示於公開委託簿。被稱為「鯨魚」的投資大戶經常透過「黑池」買賣大量加密貨幣。由於無從得知買賣雙方的交易情況，「黑池」能確保所有交易的保密性。這一點對某些人來說非常重要，一般比特幣迷卻很少留意自己是否向外界充分揭露其交易意向。（加密貨幣交易所）「海怪（Kraken）」2016年推出黑池服務。此舉顯示該類型的交易平台有其需求，因為投資者不想在買賣大量加密貨幣時導致泡沫或恐慌。


术语暗池与金融部门有关。把它看作是交易者和投资者交换证券或数字资产的私人论坛。买卖双方同意以特定价格进行交易，但是这些活动都不会在所述交易所的公共订单簿上显示。大型球员（也称为“鲸鱼”）通常会聚集在这些暗池上以购买或出售大量的加密货币。使用黑池可以确保所有交易都是保密的，因为没有人知道谁与谁交易。对一些人来说，这是非常重要的，而平均比特币爱好者将不那么关心如何让他们的意图向世界其他地方清楚.Kraken在2016年推出了此产品。似乎很明显需要这种交易因为投资者想要购买和出售大量的加密货币而不会造成泡沫或大规模恐慌。

Seoul Metropolitan Library will close an exhibition room dedicated to poet Ko Un Monday amid the escalating sexual harassment allegations against him. The city government spent 300 million won last November to open the Maninbo Library, a room dedicated to Ko on the third floor of the library.Maninbo, a title from a series of poems by Ko highlights the 10,000 people he met directly and indirectly during his lifetime. Ko has been touted repeatedly by local media as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. His works have been published in more than a dozen countries and received numerous awards at home and abroad.Ko’s alleged sexual harassment surfaced after female poet Choi Young-mi wrote a poem in which the narrator describes an unconscionable assault by a famous and senior poet. The poem was released in early February. Media and industry sources pointed to Ko as the alleged offender.Ko has denied all allegations and has not apologized to the woman. Ko’s poems will also be removed from school textbooks, according to the Ministry of Education.


在外界對詩人高銀的性騷擾指控愈演愈烈下，首爾圖書館將關閉專為他而設的展覽室。首爾市政府去年11月花費3億韓元，在首爾圖書館3樓為他開設展覽室「萬人譜圖書館」。萬人譜為高銀一系列詩作的名稱，凸顯他生命中直接和間接相遇的1萬個人。高銀至今屢屢被南韓媒體宣傳為諾貝爾文學獎得主人選，其作品在超過12個國家出版，並在國內外得到許多獎項。在女詩人崔泳美所寫的一首詩中，她描述遭一位有名且年長的詩人恬不知恥地侵犯後，高銀被控性騷擾之事即浮上檯面，該詩作於2月初公開，媒體與詩界指高銀就是嫌犯。高銀迄今否認一切指控，亦尚未向崔泳美道歉。教育部指出，高銀的詩作也將從課本中刪除。


首尔大都会图书馆将关闭一个专门为Ko Un Monday诗人举办的展览厅，因为对他的性骚扰指控不断升级。去年11月，市政府花费了3亿韩元在曼谷图书馆三楼开设了一个专门为Ko而设的房间.Maninbo，Ko的一系列诗歌的标题突出显示了他在他的期间直接或间接遇到的10,000人一生。柯曾多次被当地媒体吹捧为诺贝尔文学奖的候选人。他的作品已在十多个国家发表，并在国内外获得无数奖项。柯的所谓性骚扰浮现在女诗人Choi Young-mi写了一首诗，叙述者描述了一位着名的高级诗人的不合情理的攻击。这首诗在二月初发行。媒体和业内人士指出Ko是被指控的罪犯.Ko否认了所有指控，并没有向该女子道歉。根据教育部的统计，柯的诗歌也将从学校教科书中删除。

"If we had the chance to do it all again, tell me would we, could we?" Barbra Streisand had a hit singing this question in "The Way We Were," but when it comes to getting a new pet she does not have to wonder.The "Funny Girl" singer and actress had her beloved 14- year-old Coton de Tulear dog Samantha cloned after her death in 2017, and now has two new pups.Streisand told Hollywood trade publication Variety in an interview published on Tuesday that cells were taken from the mouth and stomach of Samantha."They have different personalities," Streisand said. "I’m waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have her brown eyes and her seriousness."Streisand said that when the cloned dogs arrived, she dressed them in red and lavender to tell them apart, which is how they got their names — Miss Scarlett and Miss Violet.（Reuters）


「如果我們有機會重來，告訴我，可能嗎？可以嗎？」芭芭拉．史翠珊在熱門歌曲《往日情懷》中，詠出這點疑問，但一講到養隻新寵物，她就無須疑惑了。這名《妙女郎》歌手暨女演員讓她心愛的14歲棉花面紗犬珊曼莎2017年過世後被複製，現在有2隻新的小狗狗。史翠珊受訪告訴週二出版的好萊塢娛樂業刊物《綜藝》，細胞由珊曼莎嘴部及腹部取得。史翠珊說，「牠們有不同的個性」，「我等待牠們長大，這樣我就能看牠們是否有牠的棕色眼睛和嚴肅態度。」史翠珊說，當這2隻複製狗到來，她把牠們打扮成一紅一紫以分辨，這也是牠們名字——史嘉蕾小姐與紫羅蘭小姐——的由來。（路透）


“如果我们有机会再做一次，告诉我，我们可以吗？”芭芭拉史翠珊在“我们都是这样”的时候唱过这样一个问题，但是当谈到获得一只新宠时，她不必担心。“滑稽女郎”的歌手和女演员有她心爱的14岁的科登德图莱尔狗萨曼莎在2017年去世后克隆，现在有两个新的幼仔。史泰森在星期二发表的一篇采访中告诉好莱坞贸易刊物“品种”，他说，细胞是从萨曼莎的口腔和胃中摄取的，“他们有不同的性格，”史翠珊说。 。 “我正在等他们变老，以便我们看看他们是否有棕色的眼睛和她的认真态度。”史翠珊说，当克隆的狗到达时，她穿着红色和淡紫色的衣服告诉他们，他们是如何分开的得到了他们的名字 - 思嘉小姐和紫罗兰小姐。（路透社）

Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino have responded to director Peter Jackson’s comments that Harvey Weinstein blacklisted them. Jackson said in an interview with New Zealand media outlet Stuff that Harvey and Bob Weinstein specifically told him not to hire Judd or Sorvino for the "Lord of the Rings" movies."I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998," Jackson said of Judd and Sorvino. "I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing."On Friday, Sorvino tweeted that she "burst out crying" when she read the interview."There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure," she wrote. "Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I’m just heartsick." 


艾許莉．賈德與蜜拉．索維諾，已就導演彼得．傑克森說（前好萊塢王牌製片）哈維．溫斯坦將她們列入黑名單的評論，做出回應。傑克森在接受紐西蘭媒體Stuff訪問時表示，哈維與鮑伯．溫斯坦曾明確告訴他，不要雇用賈德或索維諾出演「魔戒」系列電影。「我記得（溫斯坦兄弟創辦的）米拉麥克斯影業告訴我們，與她們共事是夢魘，我們應不惜任何代價敬而遠之。（說這話的）時間點大概是1998年」，傑克森如此論及賈德與索維諾。「我現在才明白，這很可能是米拉麥克斯的全面抹黑運動。」索維諾週五推文表示，當她讀到這篇訪問時，她「突然哭了出來」。「這就是了，證實哈維．溫斯坦阻撓我的職涯，我曾懷疑過，但並不確定」，她寫道。「彼得．傑克森，謝謝你的坦誠。我只是很難過。」


阿什利贾德和米拉索维诺已经回应了导演彼得杰克逊的评论，哈维温斯坦将他们列入黑名单。杰克逊在接受新西兰媒体报道的采访时说，哈维和鲍勃温斯坦特别告诫他不要聘请贾德或索维诺为“指环王”电影。“我记得米拉麦克斯告诉我们，他们是与我们合作的噩梦。应该不惜一切代价避免它们，这大概是在1998年，“杰克逊对贾德和索维诺说。 “我意识到，这很可能是米拉马克斯拖影活动的全面展开。”周五，索维诺推特说，她在阅读采访时“爆发了哭泣”。“就在这里，确认哈维温斯坦破坏了我的职业生涯，怀疑但不确定，“她写道。 “谢谢你，彼得杰克逊诚实，我只是心疼。”

Did you have a bumpy start as a new driver? Venturing out on the open road, having to deal with impatient drivers honking away … it’s no wonder so many of us fail our driving tests the first time round.However, the number of times you fail your test could be a positive indicator of your abilities behind the wheel. Car insurance brand Ingenie has assessed how their customers drive by analyzing their speed, acceleration, braking and cornering during a study.All of these factors accumulate to a score out of 100. On average, drivers who passed their test on their first try earned a score of 78, while drivers who were on their fourth try scored 84. This was the highest average score of the entire study."Many people claimed to be a better driver and considered it a badge of honor because they passed first time," says Mike Ketteringham, CEO of Ingenie."However, our research highlights that the best drivers are those that have overcome failure and benefited from spending more time behind the wheel as a result."


當你開始駕車上路時，是否感到困難重重？鼓起勇氣開上大馬路後，必須應對沒耐心、一直按喇叭的駕駛…難怪我們多數人第一次上路考駕照時，總是以失敗收場。然而，你考駕照失敗的次數，可能與你開車的能力成正比。英國汽車保險經紀服務公司Ingenie，在一項研究中分析客戶開車的速度、加速、煞車和轉彎的狀況，評估他們如何開車。所有項目加起來是100分。第一次考駕照就通過的人平均78分，而第四次應試才通過的人平均84分，是整個研究中的最高分。Ingenie執行長麥克．凱特林漢表示：「許多人因為自己第一次考駕照就通過，而自認是更優秀的駕駛，並視之為榮耀的象徵。」「然而，我們的研究成果凸顯，最佳駕駛是那些曾克服失敗的人，他們因為花費更多時間開車而獲益。」


作为一名新车手，你是否有一个颠簸的起点？在开放的道路上冒险，不得不面对急躁的司机鸣笛......难怪我们中有很多人第一次通过了驾驶考试。但是，你考试失败的次数可能是你的能力的积极指标在车轮后面。汽车保险品牌Ingenie通过分析他们的速度，加速，制动和转弯过程来评估他们的客户如何驾驶。所有这些因素积累到100分以上。平均而言，第一次通过测试的驾驶员获得了分数为78分，而第四次尝试的车手得分为84分，这是整个研究的最高平均分数。“许多人声称自己是一位更好的车手，并认为这是荣誉徽章，因为他们第一次通过了，”他说。 Ingenie首席执行官Mike Ketteringham表示：“但是，我们的研究表明，最好的驱动因素是那些已经克服失败并因此花费更多时间而获益的驱动因素。”

The Committee to Protect Journalists （CPJ） confirmed that Yusuf Ruzimuradov, 64, the longest-imprisoned journalist worldwide, was freed in Uzbekistan in late February.Ruzimuradov, a former reporter for the opposition newspaper Erk, was quietly released on February 22 and has been reunited with his family, CPJ said. The journalist served 19 years in prison on anti-state charges, with his sentence prolonged at least twice after he had served his initial 15-year term. The independent news website Fergana reported that Ruzimuradov was released with unspecified restrictions.In a separate case, the trial of independent journalists Bobomurod Abdullaev and Hayot Nasriddinov is due to start in Tashkent next week. The journalists, who are charged with "conspiracy to overthrow the constitutional regime," face up to 20 years in prison if convicted."We can breathe a sigh of relief that Yusuf Ruzimuradov － the longest imprisoned journalist in the world － has finally been released," said CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator Nina Ognianova. "If President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is serious about turning a new page in his country’s treatment of the media, restrictions will be dropped against Ruzimuradov, charges will be dropped against Bobomurod Abdullaev and Hayot Nasriddinov."


「保護記者委員會（CPJ）」證實，全球監禁最久的記者、現年64歲的魯茲穆拉道夫，2月下旬在烏茲別克獲釋。前反對派報紙「自由報」記者魯茲穆拉道夫，在2月22日悄然獲釋，並與其家人團聚，CPJ指出。這名記者以反國家罪名服刑19年，在他服完原本的15年刑期後，其刑罰至少兩度延長。據獨立新聞網站「費爾干納」報導，魯茲穆拉道夫是在附帶不明限制的情況下被釋放。在烏國另外一起案例中，獨立記者阿布杜拉耶夫與納斯里丁諾夫的審訊，預定下週在塔什干展開。這兩名記者被控「陰謀推翻憲政體制」，若判定有罪，將面臨最高20年徒刑。「我們可以鬆口氣，因為全球監禁最久的記者魯茲穆拉道夫終於獲釋」，CPJ歐洲與中亞計畫協調員奧格尼亞諾娃說。「若米爾基亞耶夫總統對於翻開該國對待媒體的新頁嚴肅以對，就必須撤銷對魯茲穆拉道夫的限制，以及對阿布杜拉耶夫與納斯里丁諾夫的控訴。」


保护记者委员会（CPJ）确认，全世界最长监禁的记者64岁的Yusuf Ruzimuradov于2月下旬在乌兹别克斯坦获得释放。反对派报纸Erk的前记者鲁兹穆拉多夫于2月22日悄悄获释， CPJ说，他与家人团聚。这名记者因为反国家指控服刑19年，在服刑15年之后，他的刑期至少延长了两次。独立新闻网站费尔干纳报道说，Ruzimuradov被释放，但没有具体限制。在另一起案件中，独立记者Bobomurod Abdullaev和Hayot Nasriddinov的审判将于下周在塔什干开始。负责“推翻宪法制度的阴谋”的记者，如果被判有罪，将面临长达20年的监禁。“我们可以松了一口气，世界上监禁最长的记者Yusuf Ruzimuradov终于获释，“CPJ欧洲和中亚项目协调员Nina Ognianova说。 “如果总统沙尔卡特米尔齐耶耶夫认真对待他的国家对媒体的处理新的一页，将限制对Ruzimuradov的限制，对Bobomurod Abdullaev和Hayot Nasriddinov的指控将下降。”

President Donald Trump has dropped more than 200 spots since last year on the latest Forbes World’s Billionaires list. The magazine estimates his net worth at $3.1 billion, down from $3.5 billion last year.Trump was placed as the 544th richest person on the magazine’s list last year but has now dropped to 766th, with more than $400 million wiped off his wealth. Trump’s fortune fell in part due to declining Manhattan real estate values, as well as lower revenues at several Trump golf properties.Trump inherited part of the wealth from his father Fred, who developed low-cost housing in the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. Trump stepped away from his businesses when he entered the White House, handing control to his two eldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric.Trump has often bragged that he’s worth far more than Forbes’ estimates, claiming in a campaign filing in 2016 that his fortune was "in excess of $10 billion."


美國總統唐納．川普在最新的富比世世界億萬富豪榜上，排名自去年開始下跌超過200名。該雜誌估計，他的資產淨值從去年的35億美元，減少為31億美元。川普去年在該雜誌的排行榜上為全球第544名的富豪，如今已降至第766名，財富減少逾4億美元。川普財富縮水的部分原因是（紐約）曼哈頓房地產價值下滑，以及好幾座川普高爾夫球場收益減少。川普的部分財富來自於繼承父親佛瑞德，其父在紐約市布魯克林區及皇后區開發平價住宅。川普在入主白宮時退出他的事業，將控制權交給他2名年紀最長的兒子小唐納及艾瑞克。川普經常吹噓他的財產遠超過富比世的估計，他曾在2016年1份競選文件中聲稱自己的財富「超過100億美元」。


自去年“福布斯”全球亿万富翁榜上，去年以来，唐纳德特朗普总统已经下降了200多个席位。该杂志估计他的资产净值为31亿美元，低于去年的35亿美元。特朗普去年在该杂志榜上排名第544位，但现在已降至第766位，超过4亿美元消灭了他的财富。特朗普的财富部分归因于曼哈顿房地产价值的下降，以及几个特朗普高尔夫球场的收入下降。特朗普继承了他的父亲弗雷德的一部分财富，他在纽约布鲁克林区和皇后区开发了廉价住房。当他进入白宫时，特朗普离开了他的企业，将控制权交给了他的两个大儿子唐•乔和埃里克。特朗普经常吹嘘自己的价值远远超过福布斯的估计，声称在2016年的竞选申请中，财富“超过100亿美元”。

Republic Protocol, a Singapore-based company, raised 35,000 ethereum ($33.8 million) this month from some of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency hedge funds to finance a dark pool for digital currencies, designed to allow big investors to trade bitcoin and ethereum in large volumes without moving the market.The protocol’s launch, expected in the third quarter, should help boost cryptocurrency trading volume, said Taiyang Zhang, the company’s 21-year old chief executive from Canberra, Australia. Republic believes that cryptocurrency dark pools could capture some $9 billion of total cryptocurrency trading monthly.What a dark pool can do is temporarily conceal the identity and order details of a trade, allowing big institutional investors to buy or sell large quantities of an asset without tipping off the wider market to their intentions.Some cryptocurrency exchanges, including Kraken, own their own dark pools. Bitfinex last week announced plans to launch a similar product to Republic Protocol’s.


總部位於新加坡的「共和國協議」公司，本月自某些全球最大的加密貨幣對沖基金集資3萬5000枚以太幣（約3380萬美元），用於數位貨幣「黑池」融資，以便讓投資大戶不必撼動市場，即可交易大量比特幣與以太幣。該項黑池交易服務預定今年第三季推出，應有助於拉抬加密貨幣交易量，「共和國協議」21歲的執行長、來自澳洲坎培拉的樟泰洋表示。該公司認為，加密貨幣「黑池」每月總交易量可達約90億美元。「黑池」可暫時隱藏交易身分與下單細節，讓大型機構投資者買賣大量資產時，無須向廣大市場揭露其意向。包括「海怪（Kraken）」在內，許多加密貨幣交易所都擁有自己的「黑池」。（加密貨幣交易所）Bitfinex上週也公告，計畫推出與「共和國協議」類似的「黑池」產品。

With the position of the US ambassador to South Korea still vacant amid ongoing inter-Korean exchanges, analysts speculate that an official with a military background may surface as a viable candidate."There are talks in the diplomatic sphere that someone with a military background may fill the position," Shin Beom-chul, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told the Korea Herald. The ambassador post － which has been vacant for over a year － is currently held in the interim by charge d’affaires Marc Knapper.Shin said the diplomatic circle here is talking about a number of candidates, including now-retired US and UN Korea Forces Commander Gen. Walter Sharp. There is a high possibility that a hard-liner with a hawkish stance may set foot in Seoul to stand on the same page with the Trump administration, according to Shin.


美國駐南韓大使的職位在兩韓持續交流下依舊懸缺，分析家推測，有軍事背景的官員或許會成為可能人選。南韓「國立外交院」教授申範澈向「韓國先驅報」表示，「外交界傳言，有軍事背景的人士可能填補空缺」。迄今出缺逾1年的美國駐韓大使一職，目前由臨時代辦馬克．納柏代理。


鉴于美国驻韩国大使的位置在朝韩交流中仍然空缺，分析人士推测，有军事背景的官员可能会成为一个可行的候选人。“外交领域的谈判中有军事背景的人可能会填补空缺，“韩国国家外交学院教授Shin Beom-chul告诉韩国先驱报。这位空缺一年以上的大使职位目前暂时由临时代办Marc Knapper担任。辛说，这里的外交部门正在谈论一些候选人，包括现在退休的美国和联合国驻韩国部队指挥官沃尔特夏普将军。 Shin说，具有强硬立场的强硬派很可能踏上首尔与特朗普政府站在同一页。

Children with African roots sent a letter of protest to a former Cabinet member over a comment they say has stoked fears about discrimination and set Japan back in terms of accepting black people."We sincerely would like you to apologize to all people who confront discrimination and are courageous enough to speak against it," read the letter, sent on Dec. 14 to Kozo Yamamoto, a senior lawmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.Yamamoto, a former minister in charge of regional revitalization, touched off the controversy on Nov. 23 at a seminar in Kita-Kyushu for fellow LDP lawmaker Asahiko Mihara, who has promoted exchanges and aid activities with Africa."Mihara loves Africa to the extent that I thought, ’Why does he love that black so much?’"Yamamoto said.He later denied any discriminatory intention, saying he was not referring to black people with the remark, but places with "Dark Continent" in mind.

Here is a saying ’one good turn deserves another’ - and in Pastor John Greenaway’s case, it has proved to be true.He and his family gave shelter to a homeless man in 2016, after a chance meeting in a book shop. Belfast man Melvin Boyd had fallen on hard times, but said once he met Pastor Greenaway’s family and began living with them, his life changed. In turn, Boyd changed a life when he offered the pastor, who needed an organ transplant, one of his kidneys.Boyd said living on the streets was difficult and that he could not trust anyone. After meeting the pastor’s son, who brought him to the family home, the Greenaway family helped Boyd to beat his alcohol addiction and start over.Pastor Greenaway said： "I believed Melvin needed a new start in life, we wanted to help him" Since then, Boyd has stayed at the family home every day and night, and has become another son to the pastor, and his wife, who already have four children.Last March, he repaid the pastor for his generosity by donating one of his kidneys to him. Pastor Greenaway had kidney failure and had been on dialysis for almost a year before the operation. That’s when Mr Boyd stepped in. He said： "There was no agonising about it. I believe it was meant to be."


諺語有云「善有善報」—格林威牧師的例子就是明證。2016年他與家人在一家書店和一名遊民偶遇後，給予該男庇護。貝爾發斯特男子梅爾文．伯伊德之前陷入困境，但他說，他遇見格林威牧師一家，並開始與他們一起生活後，他的生命改變。而當伯伊德將他的一枚腎提供給需要器官移植的牧師後，他反過來也改變了一個生命。伯伊德說，街頭生活艱困，他無法信任任何人。在與牧師的兒子會面後，他將他帶進這個家，格林威家幫助伯伊德克服酗酒，重新開始。格林威牧師說：「我相信梅爾文的生命需要一個新的開始，我們想幫他。」此後，伯伊德與這個家度過每個日夜，也成為牧師伉儷的另一個兒子，他們已有4名子女。去年3月，他捐贈一枚腎臟，回報牧師的寬大慷慨。格林威牧師罹患腎衰竭，在手術前已洗腎近1年。這時伯伊德介入。他說：「這中間沒有掙扎。我相信註定要如此。」


这里有一句名言：“一个好回合值得的另一个” - 在John Greenaway牧师的案例中，事实证明这是真实的。2016年，他和家人在一家书店里偶然见面后，给了一个无家可归的人。贝尔法斯特人梅尔文博伊德已经陷入了困境，但他说，一旦他遇见了格林纳韦牧师的家人并开始和他们一起生活，他的一生就改变了。反过来，博伊德改变了生活，当他提供了牧师，谁需要器官移植，他的肾脏之一。博伊德说住在街头是困难的，他不能相信任何人。在会见牧师的儿子后，他把他带到家中，格林纳威家人帮助博伊德打败他的酒瘾并重新开始。帕斯托格林纳威说：“我相信梅尔文需要一个新的开始，我们想要帮助他”然后，博伊德每天都住在家中，并且已经成为牧师和他的妻子的另一个儿子，他的妻子已经有了四个孩子。去年3月，他为牧师的慷慨捐献了一只肾脏，他。格林纳威牧师患有肾功能衰竭，并在手术前将近一年时间进行透析。那是博伊德先生介入的时候，他说：“没有对此感到痛苦，我相信这是应该的。”

There have been a number of interesting diet trends sweeping throughout Asia. The latest one in Japan uses a mathematical formula that’s seeing increased popularity among young women called the ’Cinderella weight’.The Cinderella weight（in kilograms）is calculated by squaring a person’s height（in meters）, then multiplying that number by 18. For example, if a woman was 1.8m tall, her Cinderella weight would be：1.8×1.8=3.24 ; 3.24×18=58.32.The Cinderella weight aims for a body mass index of 18, which is officially classified as ’underweight’ on the BMI scale. Dieticians are worried the unrealistic Cinderella diet is not only negatively romanticizing fictionalized body proportions, but also encouraging extreme dieting.Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert warned of the dangers of being clinically ’underweight’. She said：’Being underweight isn’t good for your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired.’


不少有趣的飲食趨勢橫掃亞洲。最新一個是日本使用數學方程式的飲食趨勢，在年輕女性間受到歡迎，稱為「灰姑娘體重」。灰姑娘體重（公斤）是藉由計算一個人身高（公尺）的二次方，然後再乘以18。例如，若一名女性身高1.8公尺，她的灰姑娘體重將是：1.8乘以1.8等於3.24；3.24再乘以18等於58.32。灰姑娘體重的目標是身體質量指數（BMI）18，這在BMI等級的正式分類中屬於「體重過輕」。營養師擔心，這種不切實際的灰姑娘飲食，不僅負面地將虛構的身體比例浪漫化，同時也鼓勵極端飲食。營養學家萊安諾．蘭伯特對臨床上的「體重過輕」發出危險警告。她指出：「過輕對妳的健康不利。體重太輕可能造成免疫系統虛弱、骨骼脆弱及感覺疲累。」 


亚洲各地有许多有趣的饮食趋势席卷全球。日本最新的一个数学公式使用的数学公式在年轻女性中越来越受欢迎，被称为“灰姑娘体重”。灰姑娘体重（以千克计）通过平方米身高（以米为单位）计算，然后乘以18。例如，如果一名女子身高1.8米，她的灰姑娘体重将为：1.8×1.8 = 3.24; 3.24×18 = 58.32。灰姑娘体重的目标是体重指数为18，体重指数正式划分为“体重不足”。营养师担心不切实际的灰姑娘饮食不仅会使虚构的身体比例消极地浪漫化，而且还会鼓励极度的节食。营养学家Rhiannon Lambert警告说临床上“体重不足”的危险性。她说：“体重不足对你的健康不利。体重过少可能会导致免疫系统功能减弱，骨骼脆弱，感觉疲倦。

Bill Gates took on cryptocurrencies and the future of transportation in an ask me anything (AMA) session on Reddit. And, while he believes innovations in transportation have positive implications, he has reservations over cryptocurrency.In the post, Gates said the main feature of cryptocurrencies is "their anonymity" － which is not good, he said, because the government needs to track money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist funding. Of course, there’s an issue with illegal drugs too."Right now, cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs, so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way," Gates said in the post. "I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and cryptocurrencies is super risky for those who go long."


比爾蓋茲在（美國網路論壇）Reddit「隨你問（AMA）」活動期間，提出對加密貨幣、未來運輸產業的看法。他確信運輸革新具有正面影響，卻對加密貨幣持保留態度。蓋茲在貼文中表示，加密貨幣主要特性為「它們匿名」，但那並不是件好事，他說，因為政府必須追蹤洗錢、逃稅、恐怖份子資金。當然，也包括非法毒品議題。「目前，加密貨幣被用於購買（合成類鴉片鎮痛藥物）吩坦尼和其他種類的毒品，也就是說，它已經成為罕見的、相當於可直接造成死亡的一種技術，」蓋茲在貼文中表示。「我認為，圍繞著首次代幣發行（ICO）和加密貨幣的投機風潮，對長期持有者來說，風險極高。」

The number of newborns stood at 357,700 last year, falling below the 400,000 mark for the first time, according to Statistics Korea, Wednesday. The figure is also down 48,000 from 2016, the largest drop since 2002.The average birthrate was 1.05, also the lowest figure since the government started collecting data. The rates in the country’s two largest cities _ Seoul and Busan _ were below one. "This is far worse than we ever anticipated. The demographic cliff scenario is likely to strike Korea earlier than expected," an official from the statistics agency said.The average age for a woman giving birth to her first baby was 32.6 in 2017, up 0.2 from a year earlier. In contrast, the mortality rate jumped to a record high last year reflecting the aging society, and indicating the nation is starting to go over to the demographic cliff. The country’s net population growth stood at 72,000 last year, also the lowest figure Statistics Korea has seen.


南韓統計廳週三指出，去年新生兒人數為35萬7700，首度跌破40萬大關，該數字亦比2016年減少4.8萬，創2002年以來最大降幅。平均出生率為1.05，也是自南韓政府開始蒐集資料以來的最低數字，在該國兩個最大城市—首爾和釜山，平均出生率更不到1。一位統計廳官員表示，「這遠比我們預期的還嚴重，人口懸崖的情況很可能比預期提早影響韓國。」去年南韓婦女生第一胎的平均年齡為32.6歲，年增0.2歲，反觀去年死亡率則創新高，反映出高齡化社會的現象，並顯示該國正開始走向人口懸崖，其去年淨人口成長為7.2萬人，亦是南韓統計廳歷來最低數字。


根据韩国统计局周三统计，去年新生儿人数为357,700人，首次跌至400,000大关以下。这一数字也比2016年下降了48,000，为2002年以来的最大降幅。平均出生率为1.05，也是政府开始收集数据以来的最低数字。该国最大的两个城市 - 汉城和釜山_的比例均低于1。 “这比我们预料的要糟得多，人口悬崖的情景可能比预期的早，”统计机构的一位官员说。一位女性生下第一个孩子的平均年龄是2017年的32.6岁，比一年前的0.2。相比之下，去年的死亡率创历史新高，反映了老龄化社会的发展，并表明该国正在开始走向人口的悬崖。去年该国的净人口增长为72,000，也是韩国统计数字最低的数字。

An English pub has canceled a charity snail race scheduled to take place on Saturday after unseasonably icy weather made potential competitors too slow to compete."The cold snap has led to a medical problem with our racing snails - it’s called hibernation," the Dartmoor Union Inn in southwest England said on its Facebook page.Temperatures across much of Europe are below normal for the time of year, and British weather forecasters have warned of bitterly cold winds and snow that could disrupt transport and cut off rural communities over the coming week.England’s public health authority said on Friday the prolonged cold weather posed a danger to elderly people and young children if they could not heat their homes.The Dartmoor Union Inn said it planned to reschedule what it had billed as "The 1st International Snail Grand National", in aid of a local air ambulance service, once the weather warms up. （Reuters） 


在反常的冰凍天氣讓可能的參賽者們慢到沒法子比賽以後，英國一家酒吧取消了一場原訂週六舉行的蝸牛慈善賽跑。英格蘭西南部「達特穆爾聯盟飯店」在它的臉書頁面上說，「這波寒流讓我們賽跑的蝸牛們生病了—這就叫冬眠。」歐洲許多地區今年氣溫低於每年這時節的正常溫度，而英國天氣預報員們警告，下一週刺骨寒風與大雪可能干擾交通及封鎖鄉村地區。英格蘭公共衛生當局週五說，延續的寒冷天氣對長者及年幼的孩童構成威脅，如果他們無法提高住家溫度。「達特穆爾聯盟飯店」說，一旦天氣變暖，為了幫助當地一項空中救護服務，它計畫把它排定的「第一屆國際蝸牛全國大賽」改期。（路透）


一家英国酒吧取消了定于星期六举行的慈善蜗牛比赛，因为不合时宜的冰天气让潜在竞争对手太慢而无法竞争。“寒流使我们的赛马蜗牛出现医疗问题 - 这就是所谓的冬眠”，达特穆尔联盟英格兰西南部的酒店在其Facebook页面上称。一年中大部分时间欧洲的气温都低于正常水平，而英国天气预报员警告说，寒冷的风和雪会在接下来的一周内破坏运输并切断农村社区。英格兰的公共卫生当局星期五表示，长时间寒冷的天气对老年人和年幼的孩子造成危险，如果他们不能加热家园。达特穆尔联盟酒店表示它计划重新安排它被称为“第一个国际蜗牛大国家” ，一旦天气暖和起来，在当地救护车服务的帮助下。 （路透社）

While politicians often follow in the footsteps of a parent and start their careers young, the presence of a 7-month-old boy in an assembly session here caused quite a stir.The tot in question was brought to a Kumamoto municipal assembly plenary session in the arms of his mother, assembly member Yuka Ogata, but was quickly removed."I wanted to highlight the difficulties facing women who are trying to juggle their careers and raise children," Ogata, 42, said after the session.The assembly’s rules do not have a clause prohibiting members from attending a meeting with an infant, according to the secretariat.But the assembly refused to allow the baby to attend, regarding the infant as a visitor, and applying a rule that visitors must sit in the gallery.Ogata was elected to the assembly in April 2015. She also has a 4-year-old daughter.


儘管（日本）政治人物通常克紹箕裘，而且很年輕就踏入政壇，7個月大的男嬰現身此間立法機關的會議，還是引發一陣騷動。被提及的這個孩子，被他的母親、市議員緒方夕佳抱在懷裡，帶到（熊本縣）熊本市議會全會上，但很快就被請出場。「我要藉此凸顯女性竭力兼顧事業與育兒所面臨的困境，」42歲的緒方會後表示。根據議會事務局的說法，議會規則並無禁止議員帶嬰兒出席會議的條文。但議會將這名嬰兒視為訪客，適用訪客必須坐在旁聽席的規定，拒絕該嬰兒出席。緒方在2015年4月當選熊本市議員，她還有一名4歲的女兒。


虽然政治家们经常追随父母的脚步，并开始他们的职业生涯，但在一次集会中，一个7个月大的男孩出现在这里引起了很大的轰动。这个问题被带到了熊本市议会全体会议上他的母亲的胳膊，集会成员Yuka Ogata，但很快就被删除了，“我想强调一下那些试图从事事业和抚养孩子的女性面临的困难，”42岁的Ogata在会后说道。根据秘书处的说法，没有禁止会员与婴儿见面的条款。但是会议拒绝允许婴儿出席，将婴儿视为来访者，并且适用游客必须坐在走廊上的规定。奥加塔于2015年4月当选为大会成员。她还有一个4岁的女儿。

A cow in Poland celebrated as an icon of freedom for her dramatic escape from slaughter has died from stress after being recaptured.The red Limousin beef cow was caught Thursday near the village of Siestrzechowice and loaded onto a truck, but she died during transportation, The Associated Press reports.Her escape, which happened on Jan. 23, garnered attention worldwide after being reported by Polish website Wiadomosci in February.Workers were leading her towards a slaughterhouse-bound truck in southern Poland near Lake Nyskie. The cow fled, smashing through a metal fence and breaking the arm of a farm worker. She then dove into the water and swam out to an island in the middle of the lake. There, she managed to evade capture for weeks. Her fans included Polish politician Pawel Kukiz, who told Sky News, "If all citizens could show such determination as this cow then Poland would be a much more prosperous country."In the end, it took a team of five people and three shots of sedatives to recapture her. According to the AP, had she lived, she would have been "kept" at "a local governor’s farm," though it’s not entirely clear what her fate would have been there.


波蘭一頭因戲劇性逃過屠宰而被讚揚為自由偶像的母牛，在被捕回後因壓力而亡。這頭利木贊種紅牛週四在Siestrzechowice村附近被捕獲，並被裝上一輛卡車，但牠在運送過程中死亡，據美聯社報導。牠在1月23日的脫逃，2月間被波蘭網站Wiadomosci報導後獲得全球關注。波蘭南部奈斯基湖附近的工作人員，引導牠走向一輛準備開往屠宰場的卡車。但這頭母牛試圖逃跑，衝破一道金屬圍籬，還弄斷一名農場工人的手臂。接著牠潛入湖中，游到湖中央的一座島。在那裡，牠成功逃避捕捉達數週之久。牠的粉絲包括波蘭政治人物庫基茲，他對「天空新聞」說：「如果所有公民都能展現與這頭母牛一樣的決心，波蘭將會比現在更繁榮許多。」最後，在出動一個5人團隊及3劑鎮定劑後，這頭母牛再次被捕獲。據美聯社報導，如果牠活著，將被「飼養」在「一個地方首長的農場」，但牠在那裡將有什麼樣的命運並不清楚。

Lightning-fast processing speeds once considered pipe dreams are now on the horizon."This technology is going to offer new types of services that were not possible before, but also reduces the cost," Matt Grob, executive vice president of technology for Qualcomm Technologies, said during a 5G-focused panel discussion at CES. "The demand is really clear."5G － the fifth generation of wireless connectivity － will, at a basic level, allow consumers to download things significantly faster on compatible devices. When 4G rolled out in 2009, it allowed consumers to download at a speed of about 100 megabits per second. In other words, a person would be able to download the two-hour-long movie "Guardians of the Galaxy" in about six minutes, according to the Consumer Technology Association."This kind of ’fiber experience in your pocket’ is not a bad way to describe it. But it’s also so much more," said Erik Ekudden, head of technology and architecture at Ericsson. "Any system that we’ll be talking about here (CES), any industrial system, could really benefit from this."


如閃電般快速的處理速度曾被視為癡人說夢，但如今即將實現。「這項技術將提供過去不可能實現的新型服務，同時降低成本，」高通科技公司技術部執行副總馬特．格羅布，在消費性電子展（CES）一場聚焦於5G的小組討論會上如是說。「需求很清楚。」5G（第五代行動通訊）將從基礎層面上，讓消費者超級快速地透過相容裝置下載資訊。2009年第四代行動通訊（4G）技術推出時，消費者能以約每秒100MB（MB：百萬位元）的速度下載。根據美國「消費科技協會」（CTA），這相當於約6分鐘即可下載一部2小時長的《星際異攻隊》電影。「用『口袋裡的光纖體驗』這類敘述形容5G技術很不賴。但它遠不只如此，」愛立信科技與自動化技術長埃里克．艾庫丹表示。「我們在這裡（消費性電子展）談論的任何系統、任何工業系統，都能真正地從這種技術中獲益。」


快速处理速度曾经被认为是管道梦想现在即将来临，“这项技术将提供以前不可能实现的新型服务，同时也降低了成本，”高通公司技术执行副总裁Matt Grob ，在CES举行的5G专题小组讨论中表示。 “需求非常明显。”5G--第五代无线连接 - 将在基本层面上让消费者在兼容设备上下载速度更快。当4G在2009年推出时，它允许消费者以每秒约100兆比特的速度下载。换句话说，根据消费者技术协会的消息，一个人可以在大约六分钟内下载两小时的电影“银河护卫队”，“这种&amp;amp;#39;口袋里的纤维体验&amp;amp;#39;不是一种坏的方式来描述它，但它也是如此，“爱立信技术和架构主管Erik Ekudden说。 “我们在这里讨论的任何系统（CES），任何工业系统，都可以从中受益。”

During a meeting with lawmakers Tuesday, the Army said it will create "dronbot" battle units for surveillance and combat mission at Ground Operations Command scheduled to be established this year. Assigned to division-level units and above, the dronbot units would help the military to detect and destroy North Korea’s missile site and long-range artilleries, the Army added. In a report submitted to the lawmakers, the Army said the surveillance drone units can detect precision targets on the battlefield and relay images in realtime. Through such capabilities, the drones can support the efforts to gather intelligence on the North’s key targets － such as missile launch sites and long range artilleries positioned along the border, the Army added. Combined with the drone units, the battle robots can help human troops engage in dangerous missions such as removal of landmines and detection of chemical weapons. 


週二與南韓國會議員開會時，南韓陸軍表示，將創建「無人機機器人」戰鬥部隊，為預定今年成立的「地面作戰司令部」執行監視和戰鬥任務。陸軍還提到，這些被分派至師級（含）以上單位的無人機機器人部隊，將有助軍方偵察與摧毀北韓飛彈陣地及長程火砲。在提交國會議員的報告中，陸軍指稱，無人機監視部隊能偵察戰場上的精準目標，並傳送即時影像。陸軍補充說，藉由此等能力，這些無人機可支援情蒐飛彈發射場以及沿兩韓邊界部署的長程火砲等北韓重要目標的任務。與無人機部隊搭配時，戰鬥機器人則能協助官兵從事移除地雷和偵察化學武器這類危險任務。


在星期二与立法者会面时，陆军表示将在计划于今年成立的地面作战司令部建立“飞镖”战斗单位，用于监视和作战任务。美国陆军补充道，指定给部队级以上部队的单位将帮助军方发现并摧毁朝鲜的导弹基地和远程炮兵。在向立法者提交的报告中，陆军称监视无人机可以检测战场上的精确目标并实时传递图像。通过这种能力，无人驾驶飞机可以支持收集关于北部主要目标的情报 - 例如导弹发射场和边界沿线的远程炮兵。陆军补充说。与无人机单元相结合，战斗机器人可以帮助人类部队参与危险的任务，如清除地雷和发现化学武器。

Egg sandwiches. Bacon and eggs. Egg salad. Eggs on toast. Scrambled eggs. After taking receipt of 15,000 eggs instead of the 1,500 they wanted, Norway’s team at this month’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics may have a pretty limited menu.Norwegian chef de mission Tore Øvrebø struggled to suggest what they will do with the delivery, but did not rule out consuming them. Their registered 121-strong delegation of athletes and officials would get plenty of protein, eating 124 eggs each."The eggs was more like a misunderstanding than something that we needed, so it was an extra zero on the order, so 1,500 to 15,000," he said with a rueful laugh."They will probably use them I guess and I don’t know, maybe the people that supplied us with them will take them back I don’t know. It’s not a big issue."Øvrebø said it was important to enjoy the Games as well as scramble for medals."The aim is to have fun, and be as good friends when we go back as when we came here. In the meantime we are hoping for 30 medals."


雞蛋三明治、培根蛋、雞蛋沙拉、吐司蛋、炒蛋。在收到1.5萬顆蛋，而非他們想要的1500顆以後，挪威隊在本月的平昌冬季奧運會的菜單可能相當有限。挪威代表團團長托雷．奧夫雷博奮力地提出他們將用這批貨做什麼，但未排除吃掉它們。代表團登記的運動員及官員多達121人，將攝取豐富蛋白質，每人吃124顆蛋。他苦笑說道，「這些蛋比較像是一場誤會，而非我們所需，所以它是在訂單上多個零，以致1500顆變成1.5萬顆。」「我猜他們會吃了這些蛋，我不知道，或許把它們供應給我們的人會回收它們，我不知道。這不是什麼大不了的事。」奧夫雷博說，盡情享受比賽及爭取獎牌才重要。「目的是開心，還有回國後如同我們來這裡的時候一樣當好朋友。同時，我們希望拿30面獎牌。」
