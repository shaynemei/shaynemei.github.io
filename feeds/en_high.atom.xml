&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A collection manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science, when updating the electronic system catalog, discovered this "real" pale yellow egg in more than 1,000 egg collections."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops.

Eight years ago, the 35-year-old Iranian woman was permanently disfigured simply because she had filed a divorce. Since Iran’s strict implementation of Islamic law, she has never been rehabilitated. In the end, the husband’s family also threatened that if she offered to tell, her son would suffer the same punishment. She said: "I chose my son, not justice." But she also said that she had let go of this heartbreaking decision and refused to collapse because of this decision. &lt;strong&gt;Recently, she participated in a group of victims of other acid abuse, exhibiting works together at a gallery in Tehran to raise social concerns and fundraising.&lt;/strong&gt; Adi created pottery, carved bowls and sculptures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

西班牙文「國家報」報導，一名受到神職人員性侵犯的智利男子表示，教宗方濟各告訴他，天主造他為同志，也愛如此的他。性侵受害者胡安‧卡洛斯‧克魯茲告訴「國家報」，教宗在私下對話時告訴他：「你是同性戀並不重要。天主如此造你，也愛如此的你，我不會在乎。教宗愛如此的你，你必須對自己感到快樂。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Chilean man who suffered clerical sexual abuse has said Pope Francis told him that God had made him gay and loved him that way, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.Abuse victim Juan Carlos Cruz told El Pais that Pope Francis had told in a private conversation: "The fact that you are gay does not matter. God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest. The man was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.&lt;/p&gt;

值此首爾和華府磋商前者在維持約2.85萬駐韓美軍開銷上的分攤比例之際，南韓國營「韓國國防研究院」副研究員柳俊亨發表相關分析。他估計，首爾2015年為駐韓美軍支出的經費約5.4兆韓元（50億美元），日本則支付近6.77兆韓元。但鑑於2015年駐日美軍的人數乃駐韓美軍的兩倍以上，故首爾負擔的費用更多。柳俊亨在南韓執政黨「共同民主黨」國會議員金炅俠舉辦的論壇中表示，「由於兵員的總數，為了資助美國駐軍，南韓在各類開支上付得都比日本多」。自1991年起，首爾即根據「特別措施協定」提供（美軍）財務及其他支持。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Yu Jun-hyung, associate research fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, released the analysis as Seoul and Washington are in talks over the former’s share of the cost for maintaining some 28,500 US troops here.He put Seoul’s expenditure for the USFK in 2015 at some 5.4 trillion won （$5 billion）, with Japan’s spending around 6.77 trillion won. But Seoul shouldered a greater cost given that the American troop number in Japan was more than double that in the South in 2015."Given the total number of troops, South Korea pays more in all spending categories than Japan to support the US forces," he said during a forum organized by Rep. Kim Kyung-hyup of the ruling Democratic Party. Seoul has provided financial and other support under the Special Measures Agreement since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;At the time when Seoul and Washington negotiated that the former maintained an apportioned proportion of approximately 28,500 US military expenditures in Korea, Liu Junheng, an associate researcher at the South Korean National Defense Research Institute of South Korea, released a relevant analysis&lt;/strong&gt;He estimated that Seoul’s spending for the US military in South Korea in 2015 was about 5.4 trillion won (US$5 billion) while Japan’s paid nearly 6.77 trillion won&lt;strong&gt;However, due to the fact that the number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan in 2015 was more than double that of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, Seoul has paid more.&lt;/strong&gt;id more. Liu Junheng stated in the forum held by South Korean ruling party “Common Democrat” MP Kim Yeon-hyun that “because of the total number of soldiers, in order to subsidize the US garrison, South Korea has paid more than all kinds of expenses in Japan”. Since 1991, Seoul has provided (US military) financial and other support under the "Special Measures Agreement."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Different from his dictator father, who is known for avoiding flights, North Korean leader Kim Jung-un took a plane to Dalian, the northeastern city of China, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly in 32 years. &lt;strong&gt;Since taking office in late 2011, Kim Jong-un occasionally flies in North Korea&lt;/strong&gt;Recently this trip (visiting China) overseas trip, although (location) not far from the North Korean border, the time point fell on him and US President Donner.**ner. Trump met before the summit aimed at resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. Kim Jong-un had studied in Switzerland for many years and he is believed to have frequent flights during his youth. After becoming a North Korean leader, the (North Korea) state-run media said that Kim Jong-un had used "Goshawk 1" to read the air force fleet participating in the air combat competition and to inspect the construction project in Pyongyang. Photographs released by North Korean media also show Kim Jong-un sitting in the plane, looking out of the window, stepping down the plane, and joining his wife Li Xue’s red carpet on the airport runway.

和他以迴避搭機聞名的獨裁者父親不同，北韓領導人金正恩搭機前往中國東北部城市大連，成為32年來首位搭機出訪的北韓統治者。自2011年底執政以來，金正恩偶爾會在北韓國內搭乘飛機。最近這趟（訪中）海外行程，儘管（地點）距離北韓邊界不遠，時間點落在他與美國總統唐納．川普會面、以解決北韓核武問題為主旨的高峰會之前。金正恩曾在瑞士求學多年，據信在青少年時期經常搭機。成為北韓領導人後，（北韓）國營媒體說，金正恩曾搭乘「蒼鷹1號」校閱參與空中戰鬥競賽的空軍機隊，與視察平壤的建設工程。北韓媒體發佈的照片也顯示，金正恩坐在專機內朝窗外看、步下專機階梯，以及與妻子李雪主聯袂踏上機場跑道的紅地毯。（美聯社）&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike his dictator father, who famously shunned air travel, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un jetted off to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly abroad in 32 years.Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has occasionally flown inside North Korea. The recent foreign trip, albeit not far from the North Korean border, comes ahead of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at ending the North Korean nuclear problem.Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have traveled by air often as a teenager.After he became North Korea’s leader, state media said he was aboard Chammae-1 when he reviewed air force planes taking part in combat aeronautics contests and inspected construction work in Pyongyang. North Korean media photos also showed Kim looking out the windows of his plane; walking down the stairs from the plane, and walking with his wife, Ri Sol Ju, on a red carpet placed on an airstrip. （AP）&lt;/p&gt;

Different from his dictator father, who is known for avoiding flights, North Korean leader Kim Jung-un took a plane to Dalian, the northeastern city of China, becoming the first North Korean ruler to fly in 32 years. &lt;strong&gt;Since taking office in late 2011, Kim Jong-un occasionally flies in North Korea&lt;/strong&gt;Recently this trip (visiting China) overseas trip, although (location) not far from the North Korean border, the time point fell on him and US President Donner.**ner. Trump met before the summit aimed at resolving North Korea’s nuclear issue. Kim Jong-un had studied in Switzerland for many years and he is believed to have frequent flights during his youth. After becoming a North Korean leader, the (North Korea) state-run media said that Kim Jong-un had used "Goshawk 1" to read the air force fleet participating in the air combat competition and to inspect the construction project in Pyongyang. Photographs released by North Korean media also show Kim Jong-un sitting in the plane, looking out of the window, stepping down the plane, and joining his wife Li Xue’s red carpet on the airport runway.

在多數西方國家，勞工在健身房度過午休時間，似乎司空見慣，但在瑞典，有些雇主延伸思考，讓運動成為工作上的義務。每週五，瑞典運動服飾零售商「比約恩．柏格」的員工，都會離開斯德哥爾摩公司總部的辦公室，到附近一間健身房進行每週運動。沒有人可以例外，因為這間由瑞典網球傳奇人物比約恩．柏格創立的公司，2年多來貫徹體態宛如摔角選手的44歲執行長漢瑞克．邦吉的倡議，強制要求員工在工作時間運動。「如果你不想運動，或不願融入企業文化，你就必須離開。」邦吉眼睛眨也不眨地說。他還提到，迄今沒有任何人因為這項要求而辭職。這項政策的主要目標，是希望在提高生產力和利潤之外，也能增進同事間的情誼。&lt;/p&gt;

Workers spending their lunch break at the gym may be commonplace in most Western countries, but in Sweden some employers are pushing the idea even further, making on-the-job exercise compulsory.Every Friday, employees of fashion and sportswear retailer Bjorn Borg leave their desks at the company’s Stockholm headquarters to get their weekly workout at a nearby gym.There is no getting out of it：for more than two years the company founded by the Swedish tennis legend has made on-the-job exercise mandatory at the initiative of chief executive Henrik Bunge, a 44-year-old built like a wrestler."If you don’t want to exercise or be a part of the company culture, you have to go," says Bunge, without batting an eye. So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard.

日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again.&lt;/p&gt;

Hong and the leader of the hard-line conservative party accused Wen and North Korean leader Kim Jung-un jointly building "a hypocritical peace show."&lt;/p&gt;

敘利亞學生諾爾若有所思地看著自己空無一物的無名指，接著掃視大馬士革大學裡的同班同學。在女人堆中，遍尋不著一名合適的單身男子。30歲的諾爾說自己很渴望婚姻，但敘利亞漫長的內戰，讓潛在的追求者不是移民、從軍，就是已一命嗚呼。敘利亞在2011年爆發大規模示威後陷入內戰，當時諾爾即將取得第一個經濟學學位。之後，諾爾選擇在大馬士革大學攻讀第二個文學學位。「我不知道如何打發時間。沒有朋友、沒有情人、也沒有丈夫。」諾爾一邊感嘆，一邊撥開染成金黃色的秀髮。「我很害怕在我出嫁前，頭上就出現華髮。」在保守的敘利亞社會，女性通常被期待20幾歲就結婚，但由於欠缺合適的單身漢，這些規範已有所鬆動。大馬士革心理學教授薩朗．卡瑟姆說：「女性現在就算在32歲結婚，也沒人會說她晚嫁了。」&lt;/p&gt;

Syrian student Nour wistfully examines her bare ring finger, then scans fellow classmates around her at Damascus University. Amid the sea of women, there’s no eligible single man in sight.At 30, Nour says she is eager to get married － but Syria’s protracted conflict means potential suitors have emigrated, joined the army or lost their lives.Syria’s conflict erupted in 2011 with mass protests, just as Nour was preparing to graduate with her first degree in economics. Later Nour has opted to pursue her second degree at Damascus University in literature."I’ve got nothing to fill my time with. No friend, no lover, no husband," Nour sighs, pulling her dyed blonde hair away. "I’m terrified I’ll find a grey hair before I get married."In Syria’s conservative society, women were generally expected to marry in their 20s, but the lack of eligible bachelors has somewhat relaxed those norms."Now, a woman could marry at 32 without people saying she’s late to wed," said Salam Qassem, a psychology professor in Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Syrian student Noel thoughtfully looked at his empty ring finger and then glanced at fellow classmates at Damascus University. In the heap of women, there is no single suitable man. The 30-year-old Noel said that he is eager to marry, but the long civil war in Syria has made potential pursuers either immigration or military, or they have been killed. &lt;strong&gt;Syria was caught in a civil war after a large-scale demonstration broke out in 2011, when Noll was about to get his first degree in economics.&lt;/strong&gt; Afterwards, Noel chose to study for a second degree in literature at Damascus University. "I don't know how to pass the time. There are no friends, no lover, no husband." Noel sighed and pulled away his hair dyed in gold. “I was afraid that Huafa would appear on my head before I got married.” In conservative Syrian society, women are usually expected to get married in their 20s, but these norms have been loosened due to the lack of suitable bachelors. Damascus psychology professor Salang. Casem said: "Women are now married at 32, and no one will say she was married late."&lt;/p&gt;
