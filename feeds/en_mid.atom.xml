紐約水牛城的一座博物館最近發現，它的收藏品中有一顆罕見的象鳥蛋，數十年來一直被誤認為模型。水牛城科學博物館的一名收藏品經理，之前更新電子系統目錄時，在超過1000顆蛋類收藏品中，發現這顆「真正的」淡黃色的蛋。這顆局部化石化的蛋，圓周約28英寸，重達3磅多。該名博物館員將蛋拿到美國紐約州立大學水牛城分校的藝術修護學系，接受放射線攝影，那是一種透過X射線檢視物品內部的技術。這項檢驗不僅證實他們的猜測，還照出了顯示這顆蛋已經受精的「白點」。博物館紀錄顯示，一名前館員1939年從倫敦一名動物標本製作者手中，以92美元購得這顆象鳥蛋。該名標本師在（非洲東南方海岸外、印度洋上的）馬達加斯加島買下這顆蛋，那座島是這種鳥類的原產地。這種不會飛的鳥類能長到10英尺高，重量介於770磅至1100磅之間，所產的蛋是脊椎動物中最大的，甚至比恐龍蛋還大。牠已在600多年前滅絕。&lt;/p&gt;

A museum in Buffalo, N.Y., recently discovered that a rare elephant bird egg in its collection had been mislabeled as a model for decades.A collections manager at the Buffalo Museum of Science was updating its catalog to a digital system when she discovered the "realistic" cream-colored egg among its collection of more than 1,000 eggs. The partially fossilized egg measured 28 inches around and weighed more than 3 pounds.The curators took the egg to the Art Conservation Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo for a radiography — a technique that uses X-rays to see inside an object. The test not only confirmed their suspicions, but it also showed "specs of white" that indicated it could have been fertilized.Museum records showed a previous curator had acquired the elephant bird egg in 1939 from a London taxidermist for $92. The taxidermist had bought the egg on the island of Madagascar — located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean — the birds’ native habitat.The flightless bird grew to be 10 feet tall, weighed between 770 and 1,100 pounds and laid the largest eggs of any vertebrate — even dinosaurs. It went extinct more than 600 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

In the Guadalix mountains outside Madrid, Argentine horse whisperer Fernando Noailles uses his animals to help people suffering from stress and anxiety.The 57-year-old, who spent many years in the Patagonian wilderness living with horses, uses the animals as a way for patients to interpret and control their emotions.People who come to his sessions spend time with the horses and learn through the movement of the animal what mental state they themselves are in, says Noailles, who charges up to 120 euros per session."The horse is a mirror," he says. "They are gregarious creatures, born to live in herds."The therapy consists in monitoring how the horse responds to the client’s moods. From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says."People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops.

When Richard learned from the daughter of Nian Xiaoliu that she could not reject the boy's invitation dance at the upcoming dance party, she was shocked by this.

(USA) The Cansville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah Each year, a six-dollar ball will be held on Valentine's Day to encourage students to integrate into harmony. Traditionally, teachers will tell students that they should be good when invited by classmates. &lt;strong&gt;However, the times have changed, and after learning of this year's dance etiquette, some students’ parents have become very hot.&lt;/strong&gt; When Natalie. When Richard learned from the daughter of Nian Xiaoliu that she could not reject the boy's invitation dance at the upcoming dance party, she was shocked by this. Parents teach children that there is no need to embrace friends or even kiss their grandparents. Children have mastered the right to exercise control over their bodies. For many parents, the inability to refuse the partner violates this princip&lt;strong&gt;"This kind of girl must agree to the practice, to convey a bad message to the girl - the girl can not say "no", but also to convey bad news to the boy."

Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. The needs of friendship. The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. &lt;strong&gt;However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch.&lt;/strong&gt; People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.&lt;/p&gt;

God made you this way and loves you this way, and it doesn’t matter to me. The pope loves you this way, you must be happy the way you are."Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse, spent three days with Pope Francis at the Vatican in April, in which he discussed his sexuality and the abuse he suffered at the hands of a Chilean priest.

Earth’s atmosphere contains an estimated 13 trillion liters of water vapor at any given time － that’s the equivalent to 10 percent of all of the planet’s available surface freshwater. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that it can harvest atmospheric moisture even when the relative humidity drops to around 10 percent. Under those conditions, that works out to around three liters of water for every million liters of air. Created by a collaborative team from MIT and UC Berkeley, this proof of concept device uses a metal-organic framework （MOFs）, a material invented in the 1990s by UC Berkeley chemistry professor Omar Yaghi. Depending on the metal and organic molecules used, chemists can control what gases will bind to the MOF and how strong those connections will be.The device itself is a simple design with two main parts：the absorption layer （aka the MOF） and an enclosed, an air-cooled condenser. The backside of the MOF is painted black, to operate as a solar absorber.&lt;/p&gt;

The Earth’s atmosphere contains about 13 trillion liters of water vapor at all times, which is equivalent to 10% of all freshwater resources on the surface. A newly developed sorbent has recently shown that even if relative humidity drops to about 10%, it can also harvest moisture from the atmosphere. Under this condition, about 3 liters of water can be produced per one million liters of air. This proof-of-concept device was developed by a collaborative team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California, Berkeley, using the Berkeley chemistry professor Omar. &lt;strong&gt;Yagi invented a metal-organic framework (MOF) material in the 1990s.&lt;/strong&gt; Chemists use metals and organic molecules to control the types of gases that can bind to "metal organic frameworks" and their bonding strength. The device itself can be simply divided into two main parts: the absorber layer (also known as MOF) and the envelope as an air condenser. The back of the MOF will be painted black to absorb solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;

So far no one has quit because of the requirement, he adds.The main aims of the policy are to boost productivity and profitability while fostering camaraderie in the work force.&lt;/p&gt;

In most Western countries, it seems common for workers to spend lunch breaks in the gym, but in Sweden, some employers have extended their thinking to make the sport an obligation to work. Every Friday, employees of the Swedish sportswear retailer "Bjorn Berger" leave the office of the Stockholm company headquarters and go to a nearby gym for weekly exercise. No one can make exceptions because this is hosted by the Swedish tennis legend Bjorn. Berger founded the company and has been performing as a wrestler as the 44-year-old CEO Hankler in more than two years. Bunge's initiative forced employees to exercise during work hours. "If you don't want to exercise or you don't want to integrate into corporate culture, you have to leave." Bunge said with no embarrassment. He also mentioned that so far no one has resigned because of this request. &lt;strong&gt;The main goal of this policy is to increase the friendship between colleagues in addition to increasing productivity and profits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

日本一家鐵路公司為火車提早25秒離開車站，造成乘客的「任何不便」表達歉意，此為近幾個月來第二起這類事件。該班火車原訂上午7時12分駛離日本滋賀縣能登川車站。列車長以為火車應於上午7時11分離開，因此他提早關閉車門。當時他雖發現錯誤，但因為看到月台上沒有人，便決定啟程。提早開車並未影響任何乘客的旅遊行程，但仍有乘客希望搭上車。他們向鐵路營運商「西日本旅客鐵道株式會社」抱怨，不久便有官方道歉聲明發出。日本火車以極度準時享有盛名。去年秋天也有一起類似事件，當時一輛東京駛往東部城市筑波的火車提前20秒出發，導致營運商「筑波特快」發布公開聲明道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese rail company has apologized for ’’any inconvenience’’ caused to customers after a train left the station 25 seconds early, the second such case in months.The train was scheduled to depart Notogawa Station, in Japan’s Shiga province, at 7.12am. The train conductor thought the train was meant to leave at 7.11am, so he closed the doors a little early. He realized his mistake but as he couldn’t see anyone on the platform and decided to take off.The early departure didn’t affect any other travel schedules that day, but there were still people hoping to get onboard. They complained to the rail operator JR West and an official apology was issued shortly afterwards.Japanese trains have a reputation for extreme punctuality. It comes after a similar incident in autumn last year, when a train from Tokyo to the eastern city of Tsukuba departed 20 seconds early, prompting the operator of the Tsukuba Express to issue a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;

A Japanese railway company left the station 25 seconds earlier to cause the train to apologize for "any inconvenience". &lt;strong&gt;This is the second such incident in recent months.&lt;/strong&gt; The train originally set off at Notogawa Station in Shiga Prefecture, Japan at 7:12 a.m. The conductor thought that the train should be separated at 7:11 a.m., so he closed the door early. At that time, although he found a mistake, he decided to leave because he saw no one on the platform. Early driving did not affect the travel itinerary of any passengers, but there are still passengers wishing to catch a car. They complained to the railway operator "West Japan Railway Co., Ltd." that soon an official apology statement was issued. The Japanese train enjoys a reputation for being extremely punctual. A similar incident took place last fall, when a Tokyo-bound train to the eastern city of Tsukuba set off 20 seconds earlier, causing the operator, Tsukuba Express, to issue a public statement apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;

Wood frogs hold in urine all winter as a survival mechanism by recycling urea, according to a study published Tuesday （May 1）.In Alaska, wood frogs go eight months without urinating, and now scientists have figured out how they do it – more accurately, how they survive without doing it.Special microbes in the frogs’ guts recycle the urea, which is the main waste in urine, the study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B reported.In turn, recycling urea into useful nitrogen keeps the small frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze, inside and out. Although it doesn’t warm them up, urea still protects cells and tissues, even as the critter’s heart, brain and bloodstream stop.Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm near springtime, the frogs come back to life; they thaw and begin feeding and mating again.&lt;/p&gt;

袋鼠是澳洲觀光引人入勝的要角之一，但一家公園的遊客所獲超乎了他們所求。距離雪梨有兩小時火車路程的麥覺理湖市觀光客忽略警示，餵袋鼠吃紅蘿蔔，牠們一看到最愛之含糖零食就變得具有攻擊性。受到保證「可愛野生袋鼠」是「溫馴到可以靠近及一起拍照」的眾多旅遊部落格誘惑，每週有數千人蜂擁來看一家精神病院附近草坡上的袋鼠。手裡拿紅蘿蔔，遊客接近袋鼠，想和澳洲象徵來個自拍。但結局並非一向美好。一張貼到臉書的照片顯示，一隻袋鼠跳起來，用牠有力的腿踢了一名遊客。其他照片顯示，一名婦女臉遭抓傷，一名男子流血破肚。經營到這處公園觀光巴士服務的謝恩．路易斯告訴路透，「不論在什麼情境下，袋鼠可能偶爾具有侵略性，但九成是試著餵牠們的民眾被攻擊。」&lt;/p&gt;

Kangaroos are one of Australia’s biggest tourist draws, but visitors to one park are getting more than they bargained for.Tourists in Lake Macquarie, a two-hour train ride from Sydney, are ignoring warnings and feeding carrots to kangaroos who become aggressive at the sight of their favorite sugary snack.Each week thousands of people flock to see the kangaroos on grassy slopes near a psychiatric hospital, enticed by travel blogs promising “adorable wild kangaroos” that are “tame enough to get close to and take photos with”.Carrots in hand, the tourists approach the kangaroos, seeking a selfie with an Australian symbol.It doesn’t always end well.A photo posted on Facebook showed a kangaroo leaping up to kick a tourist with its powerful legs. Other photos showed a woman with a scratched face and a man with a bloody gouge in his stomach.“Kangaroos can occasionally be aggressive no matter what the circumstances are, but 90 percent of the time it’s the people who are trying to feed them who are attacked,” Shane Lewis, who operates a tourist shuttle service to the park, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

The kangaroo is one of the most important cornerstones of Australian tourism, but visitors to a park have exceeded what they asked for. Tourists in Lake Macquarie who are two hours by train from Sydney ignore warnings and feed kangaroos to eat carrots. Once they see their favorite sugary snacks, they become aggressive. The guaranteed "Cute Wild Kangaroo" is a temptation to "tremendously can be approached and photographed" by many travel bloggers. Thousands of people flock to the kangaroos on a grassy slope near a mental hospital every week. With carrots in hand, visitors approached Kangaroo and wanted to take a selfie with the Australian symbol. But the outcome is not always beautiful. A photo posted on Facebook shows a kangaroo jumping up and kicking a visitor with his strong legs. Other photos showed a woman's face was scratched and a man was bleeding. &lt;strong&gt;Sheen, who runs this park sightseeing bus service.&lt;/strong&gt; Louis told Reuters, "While in any situation, kangaroos may occasionally be aggressive, but 90% of the people who try to feed them are attacked."&lt;/p&gt;

新研究揭露，每天吃香蕉可能有助於預防心臟病及中風。香蕉等富含鉀的食物，可防止致命心血管堵塞發生，並抑制動脈硬化及狹窄。阿拉巴馬大學研究人員分析具心臟病風險的老鼠。這些老鼠被餵食低、中或高水平的鉀，結果顯示給予低鉀飲食的老鼠動脈顯著硬化。對照之下，餵食高鉀的老鼠較少動脈硬化。 這種重要的礦物質—土豆、花椰菜及豆芽也富含—被發現有助於血液流入心臟及大腦，並可降低血栓風險。其他富含這種礦物質的食物，還包括防風草、種子、魚類及家禽等。然而，食用過多的鉀可能導致胃痛、噁心及腹瀉。老年人的危險性可能更高，因為他們的腎臟可能比較無法排除血液中的鉀。&lt;/p&gt;

New research reveals eating bananas every day could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. High in potassium, foods like bananas can stop fatal blockages from occurring and inhibit the hardening and narrowing of arteries. Researchers at the University of Alabama analyzed mice who were at risk of heart disease. The mice were fed either low, normal or high levels of potassium with the results showing that the arteries of mice fed a low-potassium diet became significantly harder. In contrast, the mice given high potassium had less artery hardening.The vital mineral － which spuds, broccoli and sprouts are also rich in － was found to aid blood flow to the heart and brain and reduce the risk of clots. Other foods rich in the mineral include parsnips, seeds, fish and poultry.However, eating too much potassium can cause stomach ache, nausea and diarrhea. Older people may be more at risk because their kidneys may be less able to remove potassium from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;

On May 19, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry. The couple will wed in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle — a royal residence in the small town of Windsor some 22 miles west of central London.The bells of St. George’s will chime to mark the happy event, but the cash tills are already ringing. Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

Tourism is by far Windsor’s biggest industry. Thanks to the royals, 7 million visitors flock to the town every year, and an extra 100,000 are expected on the wedding day, boosting the local economy.The deputy leader of the local council, Phillip Bicknell, anticipates that many free-spending Americans will be among the tourists.“The Americans are very keen on the wedding because they’re going to get in to the royal family at last.” Bicknell said. In the King and Queen Gift Shop at the foot of Windsor’s Castle Hill, Harry and Meghan memorabilia have been flying off the shelves. Tourists have been snapping up fridge magnets, T-shirts, tea towels and mugs bearing images of the happy couple and costing $18 or more. The royal wedding has triggered an avalanche of royal tat, including some bizarre products like the Harry and Meghan breakfast cereal, and the aim is obvious：to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt;

"In light of recent questions regarding my views on Women’s Rights, attached is my full statement," he posted on his verified "Courtland Sykes for Senate" Facebook page. On whether he favors women’s rights, Sykes said his fiancée, Chanel Rion, has given him orders to favor them, "so I’d better.""But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway：I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix after they become traditional homemakers and family wives," he said in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

自1999年以來，超過10萬隻極度瀕危的紅毛猩猩在婆羅洲遭殺害，研究顯示。在該島進行16年調查的科學家形容，這個數字「令人難以接受」。因伐木、（種植）油棕、採礦以及造紙業而驅動的森林砍伐，仍是主要的罪魁禍首。然而，這份刊登在「當代生物學」期刊的研究也披露，該動物仍從森林覆蓋的地區「逐漸消失」。這意味著為數可觀的紅毛猩猩就是遭屠殺，首席研究員、德國「馬克斯．普朗克進化人類學研究所」的沃伊特說。她指出，紅毛猩猩被獵人鎖定並格殺，以報復其危害作物。英國利物浦約翰摩爾斯大學教授威齊指出：「當這些動物在種植園邊緣與人類發生衝突時，人們將殺掉牠們。就在上週，我們獲報有隻紅毛猩猩遭射殺，身上有130顆彈丸。」單是砍伐森林，便可能在未來35年進一步毀滅4萬5000隻紅毛猩猩。&lt;/p&gt;

More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as "mind-boggling". Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit. But the research, published in the journal Current Biology, also revealed that animals were "disappearing" from areas that remained forested.This implied large numbers of orangutans were simply being slaughtered, said lead researcher Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. She said the animals are being targeted by hunters and are being killed in retaliation for crop-raiding.Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, UK said： "When these animals come into conflict with people on the edge of a plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we had a report of an orangutan that had 130 pellets in its body, after being shot."Deforestation alone could wipe out a further 45,000 orangutans over the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

More than 100,000 extremely endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, studies show. Scientists who surveyed the island for 16 years described the figure as "unacceptable." Deforestation, driven by logging, (planting) oil palm, mining and papermaking, remains the main culprit. However, the study published in the journal "Contemporary Biology" also revealed that the animal still "fades away" from the forest-covered areas. &lt;strong&gt;This means that a considerable number of orangutans are being slaughtered, says Voit, chief researcher and Germany's Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&lt;/strong&gt; She pointed out that the orangutans were locked and killed by hunters in retaliation for their dangerous crops. Professor Wesley of Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom pointed out: "When these animals collide with humans on the edge of the plantation, people will kill them. Just last week, we were reported to have shot and killed only orangutans. "Single projectiles." The deforestation alone may destroy 45,000 orangutans further in the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

The next time you feel stressed, grab a bar or two of chocolate - as new research suggests eating chocolate can actually help lower your stress levels.According to researchers at Loma Linda University in Southern California, consuming dark chocolate can have a positive effect on your brain health. They found that eating dark chocolate with a high percentage of cacao, typically chocolate over 70 per cent, reduces stress levels and inflammation.They also found eating dark chocolate improves your mood, memory and immunity - confirming chocolate is the greatest invention on the planet. Cacao contains flavonoids, which are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that can help both brain and cardiovascular health.Lead researcher Lee Berk said the higher the concentration of cacao, the more positive the impact on cognition, memory, mood and immunity but it is only dark chocolate that has the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

辣椒不只能讓嘴巴發疼，也可能造成頭痛。一名男子在食用被稱為全球最辣的辣椒後，頭痛欲裂到不得不去掛急診，而被記載於個案研究史冊。他的案例是迄今首例與吃辣椒有關的可逆性腦血管收縮症候群，即一種暫時性的腦動脈收縮，研究人員4月9日刊登在《英國醫學期刊病例報告》的研究指出。此類動脈收縮會導致劇烈疼痛，也被稱為「霹靂頭疼」，通常與妊娠併發症或使用違禁藥物有關。該名男子在吃辣椒比賽上食用被金氏世界紀錄評選為地表上最辣辣椒的「卡羅萊納死神」辣椒。卡羅萊納死神比「墨西哥辣椒」辣上逾200倍。他宣稱吃完辣椒1分鐘後便感到頭痛欲裂，而且在尋求治療之前，這種情況持續2天之久。初步檢查並未發現異狀。但該名男子的腦部血管電腦斷層掃描顯示，多處動脈出現收縮情況。研究人員5週後再次檢查其腦內影像時，則發現動脈已恢復原本大小。&lt;/p&gt;

Hot peppers aren’t just a pain in the mouth — they may be a pain in the head, too. After eating the hottest known pepper in the world, a man suffered from splitting headaches that drove him to the hospital emergency room, and into case-study history.His is the first known instance of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome — a temporary narrowing of arteries in the brain — to be tied to eating a hot pepper, researchers report April 9 in British Medical Journal Case Reports. Such narrowed arteries can lead to severe pain called “thunderclap headaches” and are often associated with pregnancy complications or illicit drug use.During a hot-pepper-eating contest, the man ate a chili dubbed the Carolina Reaper, named by Guinness World Records as the hottest pepper in the world. The Carolina Reaper is over 200 times as spicy as a jalapeno. About a minute later, he reported experiencing splitting headaches that came and went over two days before he sought treatment.Initial tests failed to find anything out of the ordinary. But a CT scan of blood vessels in the man’s brain showed severely narrowed arteries. When the researchers imaged his brain five weeks later, the arteries had returned to their normal size.&lt;/p&gt;

Chili peppers can not only make your mouth hurt, it can also cause headaches. After eating the pepper, the world’s hottest pepper, a man had to suffer a splitting headache and had to go to the emergency department. It was recorded in the history of case studies. His case is the first case of reversible cerebral vasoconstrictive syndrome associated with eating chili peppers, a temporary cerebral artery contraction, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal Case Report on April 9th. Such arterial contractions can cause severe pain, also known as "headache", and are often associated with pregnancy complications or the use of illicit drugs. The man ate the "Karolina Rain" pepper, which was selected by the Kim's world record as the most hot chili pepper on the surface, in a chili contest. Carolina is more than 200 times more dead than Mexico Pepper. &lt;strong&gt;He claimed that after 1 minute of eating chili, he felt a splitting headache, and this situation lasted for 2 days before seeking treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; No abnormalities were found on the initial inspecti&lt;strong&gt;However, the man's CT scan of the brain's blood vessels showed that multiple arteries contracted.&lt;/strong&gt;ted.

Sculpture artists gathered in Scotland on Sunday to compete for the title of champion stone stacker. More than 30 participants from America, Spain, Italy and from around Britain converged on Dunbar, near Edinburgh, for the second European Stone Stacking Championships. Competitors must create the most complex and gravity-defying artistic sculptures from rocks and pebbles gathered on the town’s Eye Cave Beach. "（It’s） the most ancient art form that there is," James Craig Page, the fledgling contest’s founder, said. Stone stacking however has angered some conservationists who accuse enthusiasts of "rubbing out history" by removing rocks from ancient neolithic monuments. Page insists the professional artists take care to preserve the natural and historic environment. Pedro Duran, from Spain, was named European champion for the second year running for his stone archway, while James Brunt, 46, from the English city Sheffield, won runner-up for his intricate sculpture of a rollercoaster. "I got into stone stacking about seven years ago," said Brunt. "Everyone thought it was a kind of magic, and I saw the science behind it."&lt;/p&gt;

More than 30 participants from America, Spain, Italy and from around Britain converged on Dunbar, near Edinburgh, for the second European Stone Stacking Championships. Competitors must create the most complex and gravity-defying artistic sculptures from rocks and pebbles gathered on the town’s Eye Cave Beach. "（It’s） the most ancient art form that there is," James Craig Page, the fledgling contest’s founder, said. Stone stacking however has angered some conservationists who accuse enthusiasts of "rubbing out history" by removing rocks from ancient neolithic monuments. Page insists the professional artists take care to preserve the natural and historic environment. Pedro Duran, from Spain, was named European champion for the second year running for his stone archway, while James Brunt, 46, from the English city Sheffield, won runner-up for his intricate sculpture of a rollercoaster. "I got into stone stacking about seven years ago," said Brunt. "Everyone thought it was a kind of magic, and I saw the science behind it."&lt;/p&gt;

Sculpture artists gathered in Scotland on Sunday to compete for the championship of stone stacks. More than 30 contestants from across the United States, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom gathered in Dunbar near Edinburgh for the 2nd European Reactors. &lt;strong&gt;Participants must use the stones and pebbles from the town’s eye-hole beaches to create the most complex and challenging gravitational art sculptures.&lt;/strong&gt; "This is the oldest existing art form," said Peggy, founder of the start-up contest. However, the heap of stones angered some conservationis&lt;strong&gt;They accused the zealots of moving stones from the Neolithic site and "erased history." Peggy insists that professional artists will carefully preserve the natural and historical environment.&lt;/strong&gt;ent. Duran from Spain with his stone arches, won the European Championship for the second year in a row; Brent, 46, from the British city of Schiffer, won the runner-up with his complex and elaborate roller coaster sculpture. "I was interested in rockfill about 7 years ago," Blount said. "People think this is a magic, but I see the science behind it."&lt;/p&gt;

夜貓子更能在派對上玩開，然其對熬夜的偏好，可能招致若干嚴重的壞處，一項本週發表於《國際時間生物學》期刊的新研究指出。研究人員檢視一項持續進行中的大型英國居民人口研究「英國人體生物資料庫」的數據。自2006年至2010年，約有50萬人報名參與這項研究，啟動他們的健康情況追蹤。在該次研究中，研究人員聚焦於年齡介於38歲至73歲、曾自述為晨型人或夜型人的逾40萬名志願者，平均追蹤他們6.5年。研究期間，這些志願者中有超過1萬人逝世。而相較於明確形容自己為晨型人的志願者，夜貓子的死亡機率高出約10％。不僅如此，夜貓子也普遍地更不健康。這項研究的作者指出，該研究首次顯示夜貓子更常有胃腸和神經問題。&lt;/p&gt;

Night owls may be more fun at parties, but a preference for staying out late may come with some serious drawbacks, suggests a new study published this week in Chronobiology International.Researchers looked data from a large, ongoing population study of UK residents, known as the UK Biobank Study. Around a half a million participants enrolled in the study from 2006 to 2010 and have had their health tracked ever since. In the current study, the researchers specifically looked at over 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 to 73 who answered a question about whether they were a morning or evening type, then followed them for an average 6.5 years.Over 10,000 of those people died during the study period. And compared to people who described themselves as definite morning people, night owls were about 10 percent more likely to have died. More than that, night owls were also just generally unhealthier.According to the authors, it’s the first to suggest that gastrointestinal and neurological problems are more common among owls.&lt;/p&gt;

Night owls can play better at parties, but their preference for staying up late may lead to several serious downsides, a new study published this week in the International Time Biology Journal points out. The researchers examined data from a continuously ongoing large UK resident population study "British Human Biological Database". From 2006 to 2010, about 500,000 people signed up to participate in the study and start tracking their health status. In this study, the researchers focused on more than 400,000 volunteers between the ages of 38 and 73 who had described themselves as morning-type or night-type people and tracked them on average for 6.5 years. &lt;strong&gt;During the study, more than 10,000 of these volunteers passed away.&lt;/strong&gt; Compared with volunteers who have clearly described themselves as morning-wearers, the night owl’s death rate is about 10% higher. Not only that, night owls are also generally more unhealthy. The authors of the study pointed out that the study showed for the first time that night owls have more gastrointestinal and neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
