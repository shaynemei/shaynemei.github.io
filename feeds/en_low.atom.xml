查克．麥卡錫的散步服務以每小時30美元的價格，提供新鮮空氣、運動與同伴情誼—不過在樹旁撒尿可絕對不行。這位洛杉磯企業家作為該市第一個遛人公司的創辦人，是與人類配合工作，而非動物，並捍衛健康與社會包容。「我考慮成為一名遛狗師。但我未曾在這座城市養過狗。」麥卡錫說。「我也看到許多私人教練的廣告。因此我對女友說『或許我就成為遛人師』。」麥卡錫在說笑，但當他越加思考，就越了解有對他能提供的那種同伴之誼的需求。「遛人師」2年前以1人運作方式開始營運。但需求之高，致使麥卡錫現在值勤表上有35名陪走者，人們可在網站上選擇路線與步行夥伴。不是因為人們的朋友變少，專家說，而是「零工經濟」已產生一個自由工作者世代，相關工作沒有傳統上聯繫工作者的例行公事或社會連結。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chuck McCarthy’s walking service provides fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour － but peeing on trees is an absolute no-no. The Los Angeles-based entrepreneur works with humans, not animals, and is striking a blow for health and social inclusion as the founder of the city’s first people-walking business. "I was thinking about becoming a dog walker. But I’ve never had a dog in the city," McCarthy said. "I was also seeing a lot of personal trainer ads. And so I said to my girlfriend, ’Maybe I’ll just become a people walker.’" McCarthy was joking but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was a need for the kind of comradeship he could provide. The People Walker started as a one-man operation two years ago. But demand was so high that McCarthy now has a roster of 35 walkers, and a website where people can choose routes and walking partners. It’s not that people have fewer friends, say experts, but rather that the "gig economy" has produced a generation of freelancers with none of the routines or social bonds that traditionally connected workers.&lt;/p&gt;

Chuck. McCarthy's walking service offers fresh air, exercise and companionship for $30 an hour – but peeing at the side of the tree is definitely not enough. The Los Angeles entrepreneur, who was the founder of the city's first deaf company, worked with humans instead of animals and defended health and social inclusion. "I considered becoming a dog trainer. But I haven't raised a dog in this city yet," McCarthy said. "I also saw advertisements for many personal trainers. So I said to my girlfriend, "Perhaps I became a deaf teacher." McCarthy was joking, but as he thought more, the more he knew about the kind of companion he could provide. &lt;strong&gt;The needs of friendship.&lt;/strong&gt; The "deaf teacher" started operations with a one-person operation two years ago. However, the demand is high, resulting in McCarthy now has 35 patrons on the watch. People can choose routes and walking partners on the website. Not because people's friends have become smaller, experts say, but the "jobless economy" has produced a generation of free workers, and related work does not have the routine or social connections traditionally linked to workers.&lt;/p&gt;

法國總統艾曼紐．馬克宏上週前往華盛頓進行國是訪問期間，藉由和唐納．川普總統在白宮土地上種下一棵樹，慶祝美國與法國間的特殊關係。這棵橡樹苗現在不見了——至少是暫時的。白宮攝影師們注意到，這棵樹在種下後幾天消失了。謎團隨之而起。其實，來自法國貝洛森林——第一次世界大戰一場戰役美國將近兩千士兵葬身之處——的這棵樹，被種下不久後就被挖起來。根據美國與法國官員說法，它被隔離檢疫。問題出在：樹上的寄生蟲可能擴及白宮地產上的其他樹木。馬克宏辦公室一名官員說：「事實上，能夠在總統訪問當天種那棵樹，是川普給法國的特殊禮遇。」（路透）&lt;/p&gt;

French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the special relationship between the United States and France during his state visit to Washington last week by planting a tree with President Donald Trump on the grounds of the White House.Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.White House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued. In fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem：Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.（Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;

French President Emmanuel. Mark Macro went to Washington last week to conduct a state visit with Donner. President Trump planted a tree on the White House land to celebrate the special relationship between the United States and France. The oak seedling is now missing - at least for the time being. White House photographers noticed that the tree disappeared a few days after it was planted. &lt;strong&gt;The mystery goes up.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, the tree from France's Belo Forest - a battle in the First World War that killed nearly 2,000 soldiers in the United States - was dug shortly after being planted. According to US and French officials, it was quarantined. The problem lies in the fact that parasites in trees may spread to other trees on the White House estate. An official in Mark Hong’s office said: “Actually, the kind of tree that can be planted on the day of the president’s visit is a special courtesy to Trump by Trump.” (Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

When Lebanese chef Alan Geaam first arrived in Paris two decades ago he found himself sleeping on the streets, lost and penniless with hardly a word of French.Geaam, who began his career as a dishwasher, finally received his first Michelin star from the French gastronomic bible for his acclaimed new restaurant.In the childhood Geaam had a fascination with food, watching cookery shows on television rather than cartoons after school. He started cooking while doing his national service in Lebanon, and the colonel of his regiment was so impressed he made him his personal chef.But Geaam never thought he would be able to cut the mustard in France. "I worked during the day as a construction worker and at night delivering pizzas and washing dishes. One night the cook cut his hand and had to go to hospital. No one asked me, but I just took over. There were 14 tables and I just feed the customers and at the end of the night they were delighted."&lt;/p&gt;

Jim, who started his career as a dish washer, finally won the star rating of the Michelin, the Bible of the French catering industry, for his first time in the highly acclaimed new restaurant. Jim is fascinated with food from pissing, watching TV after school is not about cartoons, but cooking shows. He started cooking when he was serving in Lebanon, so that the colonel's colonel was impressed and invited him to serve as a private chef. However, after Jim came to France, he never thought he was qualified enough to cook. “I was a construction worker during the day and I went to pizza and dishes in the evening. One night, the chef cut a hand into the hospital. Although no one asked me, I took over his job. At that time there were 14 guests and I cooked them. Finally, they enjoyed eating very much."&lt;/p&gt;

取道那條行經荷蘭耶爾瑟姆村的公路，它將為你奏上一曲。由策略性鋪設的「減速標線」所製造出的歌曲，是讓橫越那段平坦風景的路程充滿生氣的方式，但這條新奇道路已讓當地人們興味索然，他們說持續嗡嗡作響的旋律要把他們逼瘋了。曲調會在汽車輪胎壓過標線時揚出，這些標線通常配置於主要道路旁，以警告駕駛他們正偏離道路。若以正確速度壓過標線——時速60公里上限——這條路會唱出荷蘭北部擁有不同語言和文化的菲士蘭地區省歌。但音量很大且聲音四傳，當地人說，這條聲音美妙的道路造成了讓他們夜間醒來的無盡雜音。菲士蘭當局已同意本週稍後拆掉這段減速標線。（路透）&lt;/p&gt;

Take the highway past the Dutch village of Jelsum and the road will play you a tune.Created by strategically laid "rumble strips" as a way of livening up journeys across the flat landscape, the novelty has worn thin for locals who say the constant droning melody is driving them mad.The tune is created when car tyres drive over the strips - which are usually deployed at the side of major roads to warn drivers they are straying off course.If hit at the correct speed - the 60 kph limit - the road will sing out the anthem of the Friesland region - a northern part of the Netherlands that has a distinct language and culture.But it is loud and the sound travels, and locals say the musical road had created a never-ending cacophony that keeps them awake at night.The Friesland authority has agreed to remove the rumble strips later this week. （Reuters）&lt;/p&gt;

Take the road that passes through the village of Jelsdam in the Netherlands and it will play for you. The songs created by the strategically placed “deceleration markings” are a lively way to get across the stretch of flat scenery. However, this novel road has caused local people to feel uncomfortable. They said that they continued to buzz. &lt;strong&gt;The melody will drive them crazy.&lt;/strong&gt; The tune will be raised as the car's tires pass over the markings, which are usually placed alongside the main road to warn them that they are deviating from the road. If you pass the mark at the correct speed – 60 km/h – this road will sing the provincial song of the Farsland region with different languages ​​and cultures in the north of the Netherlands. However, the volume was loud and the voices spread four times. Locals said that this wonderful road sounded endless noise that caused them to wake up at night. The authorities in the Philippines have agreed to remove this deceleration mark later this week. (Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino have responded to director Peter Jackson’s comments that Harvey Weinstein blacklisted them. Jackson said in an interview with New Zealand media outlet Stuff that Harvey and Bob Weinstein specifically told him not to hire Judd or Sorvino for the "Lord of the Rings" movies."I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998," Jackson said of Judd and Sorvino. "I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing."On Friday, Sorvino tweeted that she "burst out crying" when she read the interview."There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure," she wrote. "Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I’m just heartsick."&lt;/p&gt;

Here is a saying ’one good turn deserves another’ - and in Pastor John Greenaway’s case, it has proved to be true.He and his family gave shelter to a homeless man in 2016, after a chance meeting in a book shop. Belfast man Melvin Boyd had fallen on hard times, but said once he met Pastor Greenaway’s family and began living with them, his life changed. In turn, Boyd changed a life when he offered the pastor, who needed an organ transplant, one of his kidneys.Boyd said living on the streets was difficult and that he could not trust anyone. After meeting the pastor’s son, who brought him to the family home, the Greenaway family helped Boyd to beat his alcohol addiction and start over.Pastor Greenaway said： "I believed Melvin needed a new start in life, we wanted to help him" Since then, Boyd has stayed at the family home every day and night, and has become another son to the pastor, and his wife, who already have four children.Last March, he repaid the pastor for his generosity by donating one of his kidneys to him. Pastor Greenaway had kidney failure and had been on dialysis for almost a year before the operation. That’s when Mr Boyd stepped in. He said： "There was no agonising about it. I believe it was meant to be."&lt;/p&gt;

Belfast Men Melvin. Before Boyd was in trouble, he said that he had met Pastor Greenwich and started to live with them after his life changed. And when Boyd offered one of his kidneys to a priest who needed an organ transplant, he in turn changed one life. Boyd said that street life is difficult and he cannot trust anyone. After meeting with the priest's son, he brought him into the home. The Greenwich family helped Boyd overcome the alcoholism and start again. Pastor Greenwich said: "I believe that Melvin's life needs a new beginning. We want to help him." After this, Boyd spent every day and night and became another son of the pastor. They have There are 4 children. In March last year, he donated a kidney to report the generous generosity of the pastor. Pastor Greenwich suffers from kidney failure and has been washing kidneys for nearly a year before surgery.

JPSS-1正式以NOAA-20的身分與大家見面。不過，以JPSS-1為首的一系列衛星仍然稱為JPSS系列。依循往例，美國國家海洋暨大氣總署（NOAA）在策劃、設計與建造繞極衛星時，會分派字母（A、B、C…）區別每顆衛星。而當衛星發射升空抵達運行軌道時，會再分派數字編號。「聯合極軌衛星系統」的繞極衛星（JPSS-1、JPSS-2、JPSS-3、JPSS-4）有些許不同。它們在建造、測試與發射階段就被分派數字，而未使用字母。儘管如此，它們抵達運行軌道時，還是會成為NOAA-20、NOAA-21、NOAA-22、NOAA-23。為什麼要從「JPSS」改名為「NOAA」？根據NOAA文獻，改名可延續命名規則的一致性；除NOAA與美國國家航太總署（NASA）的「索米國家極軌夥伴關係」（Suomi NPP）衛星外，該機構自1978年以來，便遵循這項繞極衛星的命名規則。&lt;/p&gt;

JPSS-1 officially became known as NOAA-20. However, the entire series of satellites, of which JPSS-1 is the first, is still referred to as the JPSS series.Traditionally, when NOAA’s polar-orbiting satellites were planned, designed and built, NOAA assigned each one with a letter (-A, -B, -C …). Then, when the satellite reached orbit after launch, it was given a number. The polar-orbiting satellites of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1, -2, -3, and -4) are a bit different. Instead of letters, they are designated by numbers during their construction, testing, and launch phases. However, they still become NOAA-20, -21, -22, and -23 when they attain orbit. Why will their names change from "JPSS" to "NOAA"? According to NOAA documentation, the change is to maintain consistency in naming conventions that NOAA has followed since 1978 for polar-orbiting satellites, except for the NOAA-NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (Suomi NPP).&lt;/p&gt;

JPSS-1 officially met with everyone as NOAA-20. However, a series of satellites headed by JPSS-1 are still called the JPSS series. Following the example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States will assign letters (A, B, C...) to distinguish each satellite when planning, designing, and constructing the orbiting satellite. When the satellite launches into orbit and arrives at the orbit, it will be assigned a numerical number. &lt;strong&gt;The circumpolar satellites (JPSS-1, JPSS-2, JPSS-3, and JPSS-4) of the "Unipolar Orbital Satellite System" are slightly different.&lt;/strong&gt; They are assigned numbers during the construction, testing, and launch phases without the use of letters. However, when they reach the orbit, they will still become NOAA-20, NOAA-21, NOAA-22, NOAA-23. Why did you change from "JPSS" to "NOAA"? According to the NOAA literature, the rename can extend the consistency of the nomenclature; except for NOAA and the NASA satellite “Suomi NPP” satellite, the agency has been operating since 1978.

For the first time, strange alien ice has been seen forming on Earth by US researchers. This revelation was made by the researchers at Stanford University on July 8, 2017. The researchers dubbed the alien ice as ice seven, which forms naturally in the environment when planetary ice bodies collide."These experiments with water are the first of their kind, allowing us to witness a fundamental disorder-to-order transition in one of the most abundant molecules in the universe," said study lead author Arianna Gleason, a visiting scientist in the Extreme Environments Laboratory of Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Sciences.Most powerful X-ray lasers were used by the researchers to create ice VII with the help of Linac Coherent Light Source. Another instrument called X-ray Free Electron Laser is used to beam the compressed water. This transformation took place in just six billionths of a second, or nanoseconds during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time in history, American researchers witnessed the formation of a strange "exoplanet ice" on the earth. On July 8, 2017, researchers at Stanford University realized the initiative. When the frozen planets collided, the ice VII, which the researchers nicknamed "exoplanet ice," would naturally occur in the space environment. "This type of water experiment is the first in history to allow us to witness one of the most abundant molecules in the universe, an important shift from chaos to order," said the study's lead author, Stanford University’s Academy of Earth and Energy and Environment, and extreme environments. &lt;strong&gt;Arianna, a laboratory visiting scholar.&lt;/strong&gt; Grison said. The researcher uses the "straight accelerator co-modulation light source" to use the strongest "X-ray laser" to produce "Ice 7". Another instrument called "X-ray free electron laser" is used to send compressed water molecules. The process of turning water molecules into ice only takes about one-sixth of a six-millionth of a second, which is equivalent to 6 nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

Pope Francis has called for a translation of a phrase about temptation in the Lord’s Prayer to be changed. The current wording that says "lead us not into temptation" is not a good translation because God does not lead humans to sin, he said. His suggestion is to use "do not let us fall into temptation" instead, he told Italian TV.The Lord’s Prayer is the best-known prayer in Christianity. The pontiff said France’s Roman Catholic Church was now using the new wording "do not let us fall into temptation" as an alternative, and something similar should be used worldwide."Do not let me fall into temptation because it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation and then sees how I fell," he said. "A father does not do that, a father helps you to get up immediately."It is a translation from the Latin Vulgate, a 4th-Century Latin translation of the Bible, which itself was translated from ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.Since the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has not shied away from controversy and has tackled some issues head-on. He has previously said the Roman Catholic Church should apologise to gay people for the way it has treated them.&lt;/p&gt;

Astronomers have identified the smallest star ever discovered in the Universe and said that it could help in the search for Earth-like planets that may have the potential for life.The star is located 600 light years away and is just larger than Saturn. The radius of Saturn is around 9.5 times that of Earth, but stars are generally much larger than planets.Named EBLM J0555-57Ab, the newly-identified star has a gravitational pull around 300 times stronger than that on Earth. Its radius is 8.4 percent and mass 8.1 percent the size of that of the Sun.It is likely that the newly-identified star is as small as a star can possibly become. Stars require a certain level of mass to enable hydrogen fusion to take place at their cores. Were the star in question to be any smaller, it would not likely have the requisite mass to sustain the nuclear fusion. It would have instead become a brown dwarf, celestial objects that are bigger than giant planets but smaller than the smallest stars and emit infrared radiation, said Alexander Boetticher of the University of Cambridge, the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

The 115-year-old botanical wonder - known as Lady Cynthia - will carry about 4,000 spring blossoms over the next couple of weeks. The rhododendron is often confused for a tree but is actually a shrub.The local historian Rob Johnson, 73, has convinced the town’s Chamber of Commerce to promote "the marvel of nature" as an attraction. "It’s the size of a small house and is a vibrant pink colour," said Johnson. When it is not in bloom, he says it is "just a nice, big, green shrub". He said he realised "we should capitalise on this" when he saw the rhododendron attracting comment online.Local residents in the town of 8,100 have grown accustomed to the huge shrub, which has been in Ladysmith since around 1904. The first owners of the property are said to have brought Lady Cynthia to the forestry community on a sailing ship from Scotland. Ladysmith’s rhododendron is so named because it is a Cynthia hybrid of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;

In a tradition dating to Biblical times, men rise at dawn in the rugged Cal Madow mountains of Somaliland in the Horn of Africa to scale rocky outcrops in search of the prized sap of wild frankincense trees.When dried and burned, the sap produces a fragrant smoke which perfumes churches and mosques around the world. Frankincense, along with gold and myrrh, was brought by the Three Kings as gifts in the Gospel account of the birth of Jesus.But now these last intact wild frankincense forests on Earth are under threat as prices have shot up in recent years with the global appetite for essential oils. Overharvesting has led to the trees dying off faster than they can replenish, putting the ancient resin trade at risk.Harvesting frankincense is risky. The trees can grow high on cliff edges, shallow roots gripping bare rock slithering with venomous snakes. Harvesters often slip and tumble down canyon walls.Once the resin is collected, women sort the chunks by color and size. The various classes of resin are shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually Europe and America.

據一項報告，每3人中有1人沉迷於手機，夜晚總會不斷查看。如果你是18至24歲的族群，比例更上升為2人中就有1人。此舉看似無害，實則非常有殺傷力。睡眠專家已再三警告，晚上盯著手機會傷及健康。這和手機螢幕放射的藍光有莫大關係。藍光會讓我們的身體誤以為現在是白天；換句話說，即便我們再度入睡，睡眠品質也會大幅降低。這項研究指出，「智慧型手機讓人們可以追蹤現在發生什麼事、人們說了什麼話，以及大家上傳什麼東西。這些事你可以在白天進行，但智慧型手機促使人們在夜晚也這麼做。」因此，除非攸關生死、茲事體大，否則還是把眼睛好好閉上。「臉書」不值得你一直瀏覽。&lt;/p&gt;

According to a report, one in three is so addicted to their phones that they check them constantly during the night. And if you’re in the 18-24 categories, this number goes up to one in two.It may seem harmless - but it’s incredibly damaging. Sleep experts have warned us over and over how looking at our phones at night can compromise our health. It’s all to do with the blue light our phone’s screen gives off.This light tells our body it’s daytime, which means when we do eventually fall back to sleep, that quality of sleep is not as good as it should be. The research said："What smartphones enable people to do is to keep tags of what’s happening, what people are saying, what people are posting. You can do that throughout the day and what smartphones are encouraging people to do is to do that at night."So unless it’s a matter of life or death, make sure you get some good shut eye. Facebook’s not worth so much of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
According to one report, one in three people is obsessed with mobile phones, and the night is always on the lookout. If you are a group of 18 to 24 years old, the proportion has even risen to 1 in 2 people. This may seem harmless, but in fact it is very lethal. Sleep experts have repeatedly warned that staring at the phone at night would hurt health. This has a lot to do with the blue light emitted by mobile phone screens. Blu-ray will make our body mistakenly believe that it is daytime; in other words, even if we fall asleep again, the quality of sleep will be greatly reduced. The study pointed out that "Smart phones allow people to track what is happening now, what people say, and what they upload. These things can happen during the day, but smart phones motivate people to do so at night. Therefore, unless you are dead or alive, you must keep your eyes closed. &lt;strong&gt;"Face Book" is not worth your while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

北愛爾蘭唐郡班戈鎮的一個家庭說，他們的寵物狗在5歲兒子被困於一台滾筒式烘乾機後，救了他一命。萊利．賈吉─達菲的手臂、背部與頭部受到燙傷，當時烘乾機在這名唐氏症男孩困在裡面時，開始自動運轉。亞倫．達菲說，意外發生之際，其妻正在用吸塵器吸地。他說，在他們的狗狗──科卡貴賓犬「泰迪」開始吠叫時她僅知道有什麼事不對勁。「要不是我們的狗抓狂，跳上跳下狂吠，我太太也不會知道出事了，並下樓查看，」達菲先生說。「她就是把他拉出來，是否頭先出來，腳或腿先出來都不重要，反正他就是出來了。我們將他弄出來並沖水冷卻，泰迪今晚將獲得菲力牛排，這個我可以保證，牠是非常聰明的狗。」萊利被緊急送往敦唐納德的阿爾斯特醫院，目前正接受治療。達菲先生說，救護車司機告訴他，只要被困在這種滾筒式烘乾機內5分鐘，即便機器沒有運轉，通常就會悶死。&lt;/p&gt;

He said she only knew something was wrong when their dog, Teddy - a cockapoo - began to bark."Only for our dog going nuts and notifying my wife by running up and down barking, my wife knew that there was something up and went down," Mr Duffy said."She just pulled him out, it didn’t matter if it was head first, feet first, legs whatever, he was coming out. So we got him out and cooled him down. Teddy’s going to get fillet steak tonight, I can guarantee that, she’s a very smart dog."Riley was rushed to the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, and is currently receiving treatment.Mr Duffy said that the ambulance driver told him that suffocation would normally take only about five minutes inside such a tumble dryer, even if the machine had not started.&lt;/p&gt;

「英國脫歐」已被柯林斯字典命名為年度單字。這個字彙的首次使用紀錄出現在2013年，但在今年的使用量增加了3400%。柯林斯語言內容總管海倫．紐斯泰德表示：「英國脫歐按理說是過去40年來，政治界對英語字典的最重要貢獻，因為水門案醜聞給予評論家和喜劇演員『門』的字根，以令任何事件或醜聞更引人注目。」 「英國脫歐」也被改寫以形容事件的結束，例如「Mexit」意指足球員利昂內爾．梅西的退休，以及「Bradxit」意指安潔莉娜裘莉和布萊德彼特的婚姻告終。 柯林斯年度字彙的其他競爭者還包括「川普主義」。「川普並非第一個政治人物的名字被語言選用：前例有柴契爾主義和雷根經濟學。」紐斯泰德指出：「不過，川普主義身為單字的壽命長度，可能得仰賴他在即將到來的選舉中獲勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

’Brexit’ has been named the word of the year by Collins Dictionary. The first recorded usage of the word arrived in 2013 , but this year saw a 3,400% rise."Brexit is arguably politics’ most important contribution to the English language in over 40 years since the Watergate scandal gave commentators and comedians the suffix ’-gate’ to make any incident or scandal more compelling." Helen Newstead, head of language content at Collins said. ’Brexit’ has also been adapted to describe events coming to an end, such as ’Mexit’ for footballer Lionel Messi’s retirement and “Bradxit” for the end of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s marriage Other contenders for Collins’s word of the year included Trumpism. “Trump is not the first politician to have had his name co-opted by language：‘Thatcherism’ and ‘Reaganomics’, for example,” said Newstead. “However, the longevity of Trumpism as a word may depend on his success in the forthcoming election.”&lt;/p&gt;

"Britain's Brexit" has been named as the annual word by the Collins Dictionary. The first use record of this vocabulary appeared in 2013, but this year's usage increased by 3400%. Collins language content chief Helen. Newstead said: "Britain's Brexit is arguably the most important contribution of the political world to the English dictionary in the past 40 years because the Watergate scandal has given critics and comedians the "door" roots to make any incident or scandal. More eye-catching." "Britain's Brexit" has also been rewritten to describe the end of the incident. For example, "Mexit" means footballer Lionel. &lt;strong&gt;Messi's retirement, and "Bradxit," mean that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's marriage ended.&lt;/strong&gt; Other competitors in Collins' annual vocabulary include "Tumpism." "Chump is not the first politician's name to be chosen by language: the former was Chaucerism and Legernian economics." Newstead said: "However, the length of life of Trump as a single word may depend on He won the upcoming election."&lt;/p&gt;

麥加朝覲是全球無數穆斯林的年度大事。在2016年，全世界最大規模集會之一的朝覲，將從9月10日開始。朝覲的日期由位於沙烏地阿拉伯的朝覲當局在9月1日依據月相決定。每年朝覲活動的第三天，穆斯林慶祝宰牲節，這是伊斯蘭世界最神聖的節慶。在伊斯蘭曆法中，朝覲是從都爾黑哲月（朝聖月，即12月）的第八天開始，至第十三天止。不過，朝覲的宗教儀式可在5天內完成。對穆斯林來說，朝覲是先知穆罕默德在西元632年「最後朝聖」行動的重現，是伊斯蘭信仰核心，象徵罪惡的洗淨以及進一步靠向真主。&lt;/p&gt;

（美國）猶他州歐格登的坎斯維爾小學每年西洋情人節當天都會舉行小六生舞會，藉此鼓勵學童融入與和睦，傳統上老師會告訴學生，被同學邀舞時要說好。但時代變了，而且在得知今年的舞會禮節後，部分學生家長火大了。當娜塔莉．李察從念小六的女兒處得知，不能在即將到來的舞會中拒絕男生的邀舞時，她為此震驚不已。值此家長教導孩子沒有必要擁抱朋友或甚至親吻其祖父母的時代，孩童掌握對自己身體的主控權已蔚為運動。對許多家長來說，無法拒絕舞伴有違此一原則。「此種女孩必須答應的作法，對女孩傳達一種不良訊息－－女孩不能說『不』，也對男孩傳達不良訊息。」李察說。&lt;/p&gt;

The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.But times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance’s protocol this year.Natalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn’t refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.At a time when parents are teaching kids they don’t need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there’s been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.To many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.It "sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say ’yes’ － sends a bad message to boys that girls can’t say ’no,’" Richard said.&lt;/p&gt;

(USA) The Cansville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah Each year, a six-dollar ball will be held on Valentine's Day to encourage students to integrate into harmony. Traditionally, teachers will tell students that they should be good when invited by classmates. However, the times have changed, and after learning of this year's dance etiquette, some students’ parents have become very hot. &lt;strong&gt;When Natalie.&lt;/strong&gt; When Richard learned from the daughter of Nian Xiaoliu that she could not reject the boy's invitation dance at the upcoming dance party, she was shocked by this. Parents teach children that there is no need to embrace friends or even kiss their grandparents. Children have mastered the right to exercise control over their bodies. For many parents, the inability to refuse the partner violates this principle. "This kind of girl must agree to the practice, to convey a bad message to the girl - the girl can not say "no", but also to convey bad news to the boy." Richard said.&lt;/p&gt;

A single human finger bone from at least 86,000 years ago points to Arabia as a key destination for Stone Age excursions out of Africa that allowed people to rapidly spread across Asia.Excavations at Al Wusta, a site in Saudi Arabia’s Nefud desert, produced this diminutive discovery. It’s the oldest known Homo sapiens fossil outside of Africa and the narrow strip of the Middle East that joins Africa with Asia, based on dating of the bone itself, says a team led by archaeologists Huw Groucutt and Michael Petraglia. This new find strengthens the idea that early human dispersals out of Africa began well before the traditional estimated departure time of 60,000 years ago and extended deep into Arabia, the scientists report April 9 in Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution.The 2016 Al Wusta find is probably the middle bone from an adult’s middle finger, suspects Groucutt, of the University of Oxford.

Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino have responded to director Peter Jackson’s comments that Harvey Weinstein blacklisted them. Jackson said in an interview with New Zealand media outlet Stuff that Harvey and Bob Weinstein specifically told him not to hire Judd or Sorvino for the "Lord of the Rings" movies."I recall Miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998," Jackson said of Judd and Sorvino. "I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing."On Friday, Sorvino tweeted that she "burst out crying" when she read the interview."There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure," she wrote.

不少有趣的飲食趨勢橫掃亞洲。最新一個是日本使用數學方程式的飲食趨勢，在年輕女性間受到歡迎，稱為「灰姑娘體重」。灰姑娘體重（公斤）是藉由計算一個人身高（公尺）的二次方，然後再乘以18。例如，若一名女性身高1.8公尺，她的灰姑娘體重將是：1.8乘以1.8等於3.24；3.24再乘以18等於58.32。灰姑娘體重的目標是身體質量指數（BMI）18，這在BMI等級的正式分類中屬於「體重過輕」。營養師擔心，這種不切實際的灰姑娘飲食，不僅負面地將虛構的身體比例浪漫化，同時也鼓勵極端飲食。營養學家萊安諾．蘭伯特對臨床上的「體重過輕」發出危險警告。她指出：「過輕對妳的健康不利。體重太輕可能造成免疫系統虛弱、骨骼脆弱及感覺疲累。」&lt;/p&gt;

There have been a number of interesting diet trends sweeping throughout Asia. The latest one in Japan uses a mathematical formula that’s seeing increased popularity among young women called the ’Cinderella weight’.The Cinderella weight（in kilograms）is calculated by squaring a person’s height（in meters）, then multiplying that number by 18. For example, if a woman was 1.8m tall, her Cinderella weight would be：1.8×1.8=3.24 ; 3.24×18=58.32.The Cinderella weight aims for a body mass index of 18, which is officially classified as ’underweight’ on the BMI scale. Dieticians are worried the unrealistic Cinderella diet is not only negatively romanticizing fictionalized body proportions, but also encouraging extreme dieting.Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert warned of the dangers of being clinically ’underweight’. She said：’Being underweight isn’t good for your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired.’&lt;/p&gt;

Many interesting dietary trends sweep across Asia. The latest one is Japan's dietary trend using mathematical equations. It is popular among young women and is called "Cinderella Weight." Cinderella's weight (in kilograms) is calculated by calculating the quadratic height of a person's height (meter), and then multiplying by 18. For example, if a woman is 1.8 meters tall, her Cinderella weight will be: 1.8 times 1.8 equals 3.24; 3.24 and then 18 equals 58.32. The goal of Cinderella's weight is a body mass index (BMI) of 18, which is "underweight" in the official classification of BMI levels. Nutritionists worry that this impractical Cinderella diet not only negatively romanticizes the fictional body proportion but also encourages extreme diets. &lt;strong&gt;Nutritionist Leonardo.&lt;/strong&gt; Lambert issued a dangerous warning on clinical "underweight."

US taxpayers unnecessarily spent $28m on uniforms for the Afghan National Army, according to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. In a scathing report, John Sopko said that officials bought "forest" pattern uniforms, despite the country’s landscape being only 2.1% wooded. The decision was "not based on an evaluation of its appropriateness for the Afghan environment", he wrote. A former Afghan defence minister chose the pattern in 2007, he says.In the 17-page report, Sopko writes that Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak chose the privately owned pattern over a cheaper pattern that the US military already owned. US officials, who had been searching for patterns online with Wardak, authorised the purchase because he "liked what he saw"."My concern is what if the minister of defence liked purple, or liked pink?" Sopko told USA Today in an interview. "Are we going to buy pink uniforms for soldiers and not ask questions? That’s insane. We wasted $28 million of taxpayers’ money in the name of fashion, because the defence minister thought that that pattern was pretty."&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. taxpayers unnecessarily spent US$28 million (about 854 million U.S. dollars) on the uniforms of the Afghan National Army, the Inspector General of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Special Monitoring Group pointed out. In a rigorous report, Sopoko said that officials purchased the uniforms of the "forest" pattern, although only 2.1% of the country's landscape was covered by vegetation. This decision "is not based on the assessment of the proportionality of the Afghan environment," he wrote. Former Afghan Defense Minister chose the pattern in 2007, he said. In the 17-page report, Sopoko wrote that Minister Vadak chose to own the style of ownership, rather than the cheaper models already owned by the US military. The U.S. official who was searching for military uniforms on the Internet with Vadak approved the purchase because he "satisfied what he saw." "I am concerned that if the Secretary of Defense likes purple or pink, what will happen?" Sokopko said in an interview with the USA Today newspaper. “Can we ask pink uniforms for military personnel without asking? **It is stupid.** We are wasting $28 million of taxpayer money in the name of fashion just because the secretary of defense thinks that style is pretty.”&lt;/p&gt;

All the animals have a special bond with their owner, and all the animals are rescues."He just started hugging on me," said Adams. "He just did it on his own."Adams said it wasn’t love at first sight, but now the two are inseparable."He used to chase me out of the garage; he didn’t like me," said Adams.

A mystic who allegedly predicted the presidency of Donald Trump has claimed to know the date World War 3 will break out. Mystic Horacio Villegas, who claims to be a messenger of God, believes a deadly international war will be triggered. According to Mr. Villegas, the war will be started by Trump on May 13. The international conflict will ravage the world for six months but the war is going to end, and the soldiers will soon return to their homes. Mr. Villegas said："The main message that people need to know in order be prepared is that between May 13th and October 13 2017, this war will occur and be over with much devastation and death." He claimed that the chemical attack in Syria was a pre-cursor to World War 3. If Assad is bombed and killed, this could very much fulfil this prophecy because afterwards all hell would break loose.&lt;/p&gt;

However, on January 31st, what happened to the former Norwegian Prime Minister Pandevik was not only long queues. Pondevik told CNN that he was “in line with the world” and he was questioned by officials at Dulles International Airport in Washington because his diplomatic passport had an Iranian visa. "When they discovered the Iran visa, I was in Iran in December 2014. &lt;strong&gt;They said...&lt;/strong&gt; There is a provision that visas like mys need special attention," Pondervik said. In this European country’s former leader, who detailed his travel history—his speech at an anti-extremist conference in Tehran (the Iranian capital)—Pondev said that he “thought and believed that they (airports Officials will immediately let him go." As a result, Poundwick said that he was questioned for more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
