<p><strong>Text:</strong><br/>
（美國）猶他州歐格登的坎斯維爾小學每年西洋情人節當天都會舉行小六生舞會，藉此鼓勵學童融入與和睦，傳統上老師會告訴學生，被同學邀舞時要說好。但時代變了，而且在得知今年的舞會禮節後，部分學生家長火大了。當娜塔莉．李察從念小六的女兒處得知，不能在即將到來的舞會中拒絕男生的邀舞時，她為此震驚不已。值此家長教導孩子沒有必要擁抱朋友或甚至親吻其祖父母的時代，孩童掌握對自己身體的主控權已蔚為運動。對許多家長來說，無法拒絕舞伴有違此一原則。「此種女孩必須答應的作法，對女孩傳達一種不良訊息－－女孩不能說『不』，也對男孩傳達不良訊息。」李察說。</p>

Kanesville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah, holds a sixth-grade dance on Valentine’s Day each year. The dance is intended to promote inclusion and kindness, and students have traditionally been told by their teachers to say yes when a classmate asks them to dance.But times have changed, and some parents were angry when they got wind of the dance’s protocol this year.Natalie Richard was shocked when her sixth-grade daughter told her she couldn’t refuse a dance with a boy at the upcoming dance.At a time when parents are teaching kids they don’t need to hug a friend or even kiss their grandparents, there’s been a movement toward children maintaining control of their own bodies.To many parents, not being able to turn down a dance partner goes against that.It "sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say ’yes’ － sends a bad message to boys that girls can’t say ’no,’" Richard said.</p>

(USA) The Cansville Elementary School in Ogden, Utah Each year, a six-dollar ball will be held on Valentine's Day to encourage students to integrate into harmony. Traditionally, teachers will tell students that they should be good when invited by classmates. However, the times have changed, and after learning of this year's dance etiquette, some students’ parents have become very hot. <strong>When Natalie.</strong> When Richard learned from the daughter of Nian Xiaoliu that she could not reject the boy's invitation dance at the upcoming dance party, she was shocked by this. Parents teach children that there is no need to embrace friends or even kiss their grandparents. Children have mastered the right to exercise control over their bodies. For many parents, the inability to refuse the partner violates this principle. "This kind of girl must agree to the practice, to convey a bad message to the girl - the girl can not say "no", but also to convey bad news to the boy." Richard said.</p>

古根漢博物館總館長回覆白宮的電子郵件很有禮貌，但立場也很堅定：該館無法應允出借一幅梵谷的畫作，讓川普總統與第一夫人梅蘭妮亞掛在私人起居區的要求。取而代之的是，館長南西．史貝克特寫道，另一件藝術創作倒是可以出借，但該作品與描繪一名戴黑帽的男子，沿著法國阿爾勒的小徑遛狗的1888年梵谷畫作「雪景」，毫無相似之處。館長的替代方案是：1個18K、功能完備的黃金馬桶—一件名為「美國」、被批評者形容為尖銳諷刺美國財富過剩的互動式作品。</p>

The emailed response from the Guggenheim’s chief curator to the White House was polite but firm：The museum could not accommodate a request to borrow a painting by Vincent van Gogh for President and Melania Trump’s private living quarters.Instead, wrote the curator, Nancy Spector, another piece was available, one that was nothing like "Landscape With Snow," the 1888 van Gogh rendering of a man in a black hat walking along a path in Arles, France, with his dog.The curator’s alternative： an 18-karat, fully functioning, solid gold toilet — an interactive work titled "America" that critics have described as pointed satire aimed at the excess of wealth in this country.For a year, the Guggenheim had exhibited "America" — the creation of contemporary artist Maurizio Cattelan — in a public restroom on the museum’s fifth floor for visitors to use.</p>

至少8萬6000年前的一件人類手指骨骼顯示，阿拉伯半島是石器時代人類遷出非洲的重要地點，人類藉此迅速擴散至亞洲。這項微型證據產於沙烏地阿拉伯內夫得沙漠中一處遺址、位於中央區的出土文物。考古學家豪烏畢．格魯卡特和米赫依．派特利雅領導的團隊表示，根據該件骨骼的定年，它是迄今在非洲以外所發現最古老的智人化石，並指出這塊中東地區的狹長地帶，連結非洲與亞洲。科學家在4月9日刊登於《自然生態學與進化》期刊的報告中表示，這項新發現強化了以下觀點：早期人類遷出非洲的時間，早於傳統上估計的6萬年前，人類的擴散並曾深入阿拉伯半島。牛津大學的格魯卡特猜測，這件2016年在中央區的發現，可能是一名成人的中指中節指骨。但還不清楚這塊骨骼來自男性或女性，是右手或左手。</p>

A single human finger bone from at least 86,000 years ago points to Arabia as a key destination for Stone Age excursions out of Africa that allowed people to rapidly spread across Asia.Excavations at Al Wusta, a site in Saudi Arabia’s Nefud desert, produced this diminutive discovery. It’s the oldest known Homo sapiens fossil outside of Africa and the narrow strip of the Middle East that joins Africa with Asia, based on dating of the bone itself, says a team led by archaeologists Huw Groucutt and Michael Petraglia. This new find strengthens the idea that early human dispersals out of Africa began well before the traditional estimated departure time of 60,000 years ago and extended deep into Arabia, the scientists report April 9 in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.The 2016 Al Wusta find is probably the middle bone from an adult’s middle finger, suspects Groucutt, of the University of Oxford. It’s unclear whether the bone came from a man or a woman, or from a right or left hand.\n新聞辭典</p>

At least 80,000 years ago, the skeleton of a human finger showed that the Arabian peninsula was an important place for humans to move out of Africa during the Stone Age, and humanity quickly spread to Asia. This miniature evidence was produced at a site in the Nefde Desert in Saudi Arabia and was found in the Central District. Archaeologist Howe. <strong>Grukat and Mihei.</strong> The team led by Patria has stated that according to the dating of the skeleton, it is the oldest Homo sapiens found outside Africa so far, and points out that this narrow strip of Middle East connects Africa with Asia.

Proliferated and went deep into the Arabian Peninsula. Glencroft of Oxford University speculated that this discovery in Central District in 2016 may be the middle finger of an adult's middle finger.

Former Stanford president John Hennessy and UC Berkeley professor emeritus Dave Patterson won the $1 million 2017 Alan Turing Award on Wednesday for their breakthrough work in designing energy-efficient chips in the 1980s that set the stage for smartphones’ omnipresence today.They won the Turing Award for their separate projects at Stanford and Berkeley in the early 1980s that pioneered a new microprocessor design called reduced instruction set computer (RISC), coined by Patterson and his Berkeley team.RISC’s architecture allowed the chip to use a small, highly optimized set of instructions, saving energy and time while outperforming its competition. Today, nearly 99 percent of the 16 billion microprocessors produced every year are RISC processors, and they are found in nearly all smartphones, tablets and other smart devices, according to the ACM.</p>

Patterson and his team at Berkeley created "Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)", both of whom are pioneers of this new type of microprocessor design. The "Streamlined Instruction Set" architecture allows the chip to operate with streamlined, highly-optimized instructions, saving electricity and time, and surpassing the competition. According to ACM, nearly 99% of the 16 billion microprocessors produced each year are now "reduced instruction set" processors.

不少有趣的飲食趨勢橫掃亞洲。最新一個是日本使用數學方程式的飲食趨勢，在年輕女性間受到歡迎，稱為「灰姑娘體重」。灰姑娘體重（公斤）是藉由計算一個人身高（公尺）的二次方，然後再乘以18。例如，若一名女性身高1.8公尺，她的灰姑娘體重將是：1.8乘以1.8等於3.24；3.24再乘以18等於58.32。灰姑娘體重的目標是身體質量指數（BMI）18，這在BMI等級的正式分類中屬於「體重過輕」。營養師擔心，這種不切實際的灰姑娘飲食，不僅負面地將虛構的身體比例浪漫化，同時也鼓勵極端飲食。營養學家萊安諾．蘭伯特對臨床上的「體重過輕」發出危險警告。她指出：「過輕對妳的健康不利。體重太輕可能造成免疫系統虛弱、骨骼脆弱及感覺疲累。」</p>

There have been a number of interesting diet trends sweeping throughout Asia. The latest one in Japan uses a mathematical formula that’s seeing increased popularity among young women called the ’Cinderella weight’.The Cinderella weight（in kilograms）is calculated by squaring a person’s height（in meters）, then multiplying that number by 18. For example, if a woman was 1.8m tall, her Cinderella weight would be：1.8×1.8=3.24 ; 3.24×18=58.32.The Cinderella weight aims for a body mass index of 18, which is officially classified as ’underweight’ on the BMI scale. Dieticians are worried the unrealistic Cinderella diet is not only negatively romanticizing fictionalized body proportions, but also encouraging extreme dieting.Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert warned of the dangers of being clinically ’underweight’. She said：’Being underweight isn’t good for your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired.’</p>

Many interesting dietary trends sweep across Asia. The latest one is Japan's dietary trend using mathematical equations. It is popular among young women and is called "Cinderella Weight." Cinderella's weight (in kilograms) is calculated by calculating the quadratic height of a person's height (meter), and then multiplying by 18. For example, if a woman is 1.8 meters tall, her Cinderella weight will be: 1.8 times 1.8 equals 3.24; 3.24 and then 18 equals 58.32. The goal of Cinderella's weight is a body mass index (BMI) of 18, which is "underweight" in the official classification of BMI levels. Nutritionists worry that this impractical Cinderella diet not only negatively romanticizes the fictional body proportion but also encourages extreme diets. <strong>Nutritionist Leonardo.</strong> Lambert issued a dangerous warning on clinical "underweight." She pointed out: "It is not good for your health to be too light. Being too light can result in weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired."</p>

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz has ordered an over-enthusiastic columnist to be suspended from his job after he equated him with God, Saudi media reported on Sunday.King Salman has frequently been lauded by columnists in local media, in traditional deference to authority, since the 81-year-old assumed office in 2015.But Ramadan al-Anzi’s column in al-Jazirah newspaper describing King Salman as "Haleem", or forbearing, and "Shadeed al-Eqab", strict in punishment - both terms associated in Islam with God - appeared to have gone too far.The newspaper published an apology late on Saturday.</p>

Saudi Arabian media reported on Sunday that King Salman. Bin. Abdelaziz ordered an overzealous columnist to suspend his job after he had put the king and Allah on the equal sign. The Sha State media has traditionally complied with its authority. Since King Salman came to office at the age of 81 in 2015, he has often been praised by media columnists. <strong>But Ramadan.</strong> Aian Qi’s column in the “Israeli News” described King Salman as “broad forbearance,” and “does not use indiscriminate punishment” — both of which are related to Allah in Islam — and seem excessive.</p>

美國納稅人不必要地耗費2800萬美元（約8.54億台幣）在阿富汗國民軍的制服上，阿富汗重建特別監察小組監察長指出。在一份措辭嚴厲的報告中，索普科說，官員採購「森林」圖樣的制服，儘管該國地景僅2.1％為植被所覆蓋。這項決定「不是根據阿富汗環境相稱性的評估。」他寫道。前阿富汗國防部長2007年選擇該圖樣，他說。在這份17頁的報告中，索普科寫道，部長瓦達克選擇所有權私人所屬的款式，而非美軍已有的較廉價款式。與瓦達克一同在網路上搜尋軍服款式的美國官員，因他「中意他所看到的」而批准這項採購案。「我關切的是，要是國防部長喜歡紫色或粉紅色，又會怎樣呢？」索普科在「今日美國報」的訪問中說。「我們會問都不問地就為軍人採購粉紅色軍服嗎？那是愚蠢至極。我們以時尚的名義，浪費2800萬美元納稅人的錢，只是因為這位國防部長認為那種款式漂亮。」</p>

US taxpayers unnecessarily spent $28m on uniforms for the Afghan National Army, according to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. In a scathing report, John Sopko said that officials bought "forest" pattern uniforms, despite the country’s landscape being only 2.1% wooded. The decision was "not based on an evaluation of its appropriateness for the Afghan environment", he wrote. A former Afghan defence minister chose the pattern in 2007, he says.In the 17-page report, Sopko writes that Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak chose the privately owned pattern over a cheaper pattern that the US military already owned. US officials, who had been searching for patterns online with Wardak, authorised the purchase because he "liked what he saw"."My concern is what if the minister of defence liked purple, or liked pink?" Sopko told USA Today in an interview. "Are we going to buy pink uniforms for soldiers and not ask questions? That’s insane. We wasted $28 million of taxpayers’ money in the name of fashion, because the defence minister thought that that pattern was pretty."</p>

In the 17-page report, Sopoko wrote that Minister Vadak chose to own the style of ownership, rather than the cheaper models already owned by the US military. The U.S. official who was searching for military uniforms on the Internet with Vadak approved the purchase because he "satisfied what he saw." "I am concerned that if the Secretary of Defense likes purple or pink, what will happen?"

根據「有線－衛星公共事務網絡」公佈的總統歷史學家調查，亞伯拉罕．林肯、喬治．華盛頓、狄奧多（泰迪）．羅斯福和富蘭克林．羅斯福，仍被視為美國歷史上最偉大的4位總統。德懷特．艾森豪則是首次進入前5名。 這份調查要求91名總統歷史學家評價美國總統，依據10種總統領導才能進行1到10分的評比，包括公眾說服力、危機管理、經濟管理、道德權威、國際關係等。林肯仍是美國有史以來最棒的總統。 評價最糟糕的總統包括安德魯．詹森和富蘭克林．皮爾斯。在美國迎向內戰之際領導國家的詹姆斯．布坎南則墊底。同樣值得注意的是，喬治．布希突然提高3個名次至33名。 巴拉克．歐巴馬則在43名前最高統帥中排名第12名，位於伍德羅．威爾遜（11名）和詹姆斯．門羅（13名）之間。</p>
